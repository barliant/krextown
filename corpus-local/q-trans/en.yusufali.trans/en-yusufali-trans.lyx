This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear
 Allah;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Who believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer, and spend out of what
 We have provided for them;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And who believe in the Revelation sent to thee, and sent before thy time,
 and (in their hearts) have the assurance of the Hereafter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are on (true) guidance, from their Lord, and it is these who will prosper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As to those who reject Faith, it is the same to them whether thou warn them
 or do not warn them; they will not believe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allah hath set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, and on their
 eyes is a veil; great is the penalty they (incur).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Of the people there are some who say: "We believe in Allah and the Last
 Day;" but they do not (really) believe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Fain would they deceive Allah and those who believe, but they only deceive
 themselves, and realise (it) not!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And
 grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "Why,
 we only Want to make peace!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Of a surety, they are the ones who make mischief, but they realise (it)
 not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When it is said to them: "Believe as the others believe:" They say: "Shall
 we believe as the fools believe?" Nay, of a surety they are the fools,
 but they do not know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they
 are alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were)
 only jesting."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and give them rope in their
 trespasses; so they will wander like blind ones (To and fro).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
These are they who have bartered Guidance for error: But their traffic is
 profitless, and they have lost true direction,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Their similitude is that of a man who kindled a fire; when it lighted all
 around him, Allah took away their light and left them in utter darkness.
 So they could not see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return (to the path).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Or (another similitude) is that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky: In it
 are zones of darkness, and thunder and lightning: They press their fingers
 in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap, the while they are
 in terror of death.
 But Allah is ever round the rejecters of Faith!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The lightning all but snatches away their sight; every time the light (Helps)
 them, they walk therein, and when the darkness grows on them, they stand
 still.
 And if Allah willed, He could take away their faculty of hearing and seeing;
 for Allah hath power over all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who came
 before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and sent
 down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for your
 sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the truth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time to
 Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your witnesses
 or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose fuel
 is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that
 their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow.
 Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: "Why, this is
 what we were fed with before," for they are given things in similitude;
 and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein
 (for ever).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest.
 Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who
 reject Faith say: "What means Allah by this similitude?" By it He causes
 many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not
 to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder what
 Allah Has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These cause loss
 (only) to themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without life,
 and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will again bring
 you to life; and again to Him will ye return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth; Moreover
 His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and perfection to
 the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth."
 They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein
 and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy
 (name)?" He said: "I know what ye know not."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the
 angels, and said: "Tell me the names of these if ye are right."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They said: "Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast
 taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
He said: "O Adam! Tell them their names." When he had told them, Allah said:
 "Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I
 know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And behold, We said to the angels: "Bow down to Adam" and they bowed down.
 Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We said: "O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the
 bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not
 this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the
 state (of felicity) in which they had been.
 We said: "Get ye down, all (ye people), with enmity between yourselves.
 On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for
 a time."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned
 towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We said: "Get ye down all from here; and if, as is sure, there comes to
 you Guidance from me, whosoever follows My guidance, on them shall be no
 fear, nor shall they grieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
"But those who reject Faith and belie Our Signs, they shall be companions
 of the Fire; they shall abide therein."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
O Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed
 upon you, and fulfil your covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with
 you, and fear none but Me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And believe in what I reveal, confirming the revelation which is with you,
 and be not the first to reject Faith therein, nor sell My Signs for a small
 price; and fear Me, and Me alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And cover not Truth with falsehood, nor conceal the Truth when ye know (what
 it is).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And be steadfast in prayer; practise regular charity; and bow down your
 heads with those who bow down (in worship).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do ye enjoin right conduct on the people, and forget (To practise it) yourselves
, and yet ye study the Scripture? Will ye not understand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Nay, seek (Allah's) help with patient perseverance and prayer: It is indeed
 hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Who bear in mind the certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that
 they are to return to Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour which I bestowed upon
 you, and that I preferred you to all other (for My Message).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then guard yourselves against a day when one soul shall not avail another
 nor shall intercession be accepted for her, nor shall compensation be taken
 from her, nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They set you
 hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women-folk
 live; therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We divided the sea for you and saved you and drowned Pharaoh's
 people within your very sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence ye
 took the calf (for worship), and ye did grievous wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even then We did forgive you; there was a chance for you to be grateful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion (Between right
 and wrong): There was a chance for you to be guided aright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember Moses said to his people: "O my people! Ye have indeed wronged
 yourselves by your worship of the calf: So turn (in repentance) to your
 Maker, and slay yourselves (the wrong-doers); that will be better for you
 in the sight of your Maker." Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness):
 For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember ye said: "O Moses! We shall never believe in thee until we
 see Allah manifestly," but ye were dazed with thunder and lighting even
 as ye looked on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then We raised you up after your death: Ye had the chance to be grateful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And We gave you the shade of clouds and sent down to you Manna and quails,
 saying: "Eat of the good things We have provided for you:" (But they rebelled);
 to us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We said: "Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as
 ye wish; but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in words, and
 We shall forgive you your faults and increase (the portion of) those who
 do good."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But the transgressors changed the word from that which had been given them;
 so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, for that they infringed
 (Our command) repeatedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember Moses prayed for water for his people; We said: "Strike the
 rock with thy staff." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs.
 Each group knew its own place for water.
 So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by Allah, and do no evil nor
 mischief on the (face of the) earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember ye said: "O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always);
 so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth,
 -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions." He said:
 "Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and
 ye shall find what ye want!" They were covered with humiliation and misery;
 they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah.
 This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His
 Messengers without just cause.
 This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),
 and the Christians and the Sabians,- any who believe in Allah and the Last
 Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on
 them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (The towering
 height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given
 you and bring (ever) to remembrance what is therein: Perchance ye may fear
 Allah."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But ye turned back thereafter: Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of
 Allah to you, ye had surely been among the lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And well ye knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the
 Sabbath: We said to them: "Be ye apes, despised and rejected."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So We made it an example to their own time and to their posterity, and a
 lesson to those who fear Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember Moses said to his people: "Allah commands that ye sacrifice
 a heifer." They said: "Makest thou a laughing-stock of us?" He said: "Allah
 save me from being an ignorant (fool)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what (heifer)
 it is!" He said; "He says: The heifer should be neither too old nor too
 young, but of middling age.
 Now do what ye are commanded!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us Her colour."
 He said: "He says: A fawn-coloured heifer, pure and rich in tone, the admiratio
n of beholders!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They said: "Beseech on our behalf Thy Lord to make plain to us what she
 is: To us are all heifers alike: We wish indeed for guidance, if Allah
 wills."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
He said: "He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields;
 sound and without blemish." They said: "Now hast thou brought the truth."
 Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Remember ye slew a man and fell into a dispute among yourselves as to the
 crime: But Allah was to bring forth what ye did hide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So We said: "Strike the (body) with a piece of the (heifer)." Thus Allah
 bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His Signs: Perchance ye may understan
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Thenceforth were your hearts hardened: They became like a rock and even
 worse in hardness.
 For among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth; others there
 are which when split asunder send forth water; and others which sink for
 fear of Allah.
 And Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can ye (o ye men of Faith) entertain the hope that they will believe in
 you?- Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Allah, and perverted
 it knowingly after they understood it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Behold! when they meet the men of Faith, they say: "We believe": But when
 they meet each other in private, they say: "Shall you tell them what Allah
 hath revealed to you, that they may engage you in argument about it before
 your Lord?"- Do ye not understand (their aim)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Know they not that Allah knoweth what they conceal and what they reveal?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And there are among them illiterates, who know not the Book, but (see therein
 their own) desires, and they do nothing but conjecture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands, and then say:"This
 is from Allah," to traffic with it for miserable price!- Woe to them for
 what their hands do write, and for the gain they make thereby.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days:"
 Say: "Have ye taken a promise from Allah, for He never breaks His promise?
 or is it that ye say of Allah what ye do not know?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Nay, those who seek gain in evil, and are girt round by their sins,- they
 are companions of the Fire: Therein shall they abide (For ever).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of
 the Garden: Therein shall they abide (For ever).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We took a covenant from the Children of Israel (to this effect):
 Worship none but Allah; treat with kindness your parents and kindred, and
 orphans and those in need; speak fair to the people; be steadfast in prayer;
 and practise regular charity.
 Then did ye turn back, except a few among you, and ye backslide (even now).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We took your covenant (to this effect): Shed no blood amongst
 you, nor turn out your own people from your homes: and this ye solemnly
 ratified, and to this ye can bear witness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After this it is ye, the same people, who slay among yourselves, and banish
 a party of you from their homes; assist (Their enemies) against them, in
 guilt and rancour; and if they come to you as captives, ye ransom them,
 though it was not lawful for you to banish them.
 Then is it only a part of the Book that ye believe in, and do ye reject
 the rest? but what is the reward for those among you who behave like this
 but disgrace in this life?- and on the Day of Judgment they shall be consigned
 to the most grievous penalty.
 For Allah is not unmindful of what ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the
 Hereafter: their penalty shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We gave Moses the Book and followed him up with a succession of messengers;
 We gave Jesus the son of Mary Clear (Signs) and strengthened him with the
 holy spirit.
 Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves
 desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and
 others ye slay!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They say, "Our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve Allah's Word: we
 need no more)." Nay, Allah's curse is on them for their blasphemy: Little
 is it they believe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with
 them,- although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without
 Faith,- when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognised,
 they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without
 Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, in that they
 deny (the revelation) which Allah has sent down, in insolent envy that
 Allah of His Grace should send it to any of His servants He pleases: Thus
 have they drawn on themselves Wrath upon Wrath.
 And humiliating is the punishment of those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When it is said to them, "Believe in what Allah Hath sent down, "they say,
 "We believe in what was sent down to us:" yet they reject all besides,
 even if it be Truth confirming what is with them.
 Say: "Why then have ye slain the prophets of Allah in times gone by, if
 ye did indeed believe?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There came to you Moses with clear (Signs); yet ye worshipped the calf (Even)
 after that, and ye did behave wrongfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering
 height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): "Hold firmly to what We have given
 you, and hearken (to the Law)": They said:" We hear, and we disobey:" And
 they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because
 of their Faithlessness.
 Say: "Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Say: "If the last Home, with Allah, be for you specially, and not for anyone
 else, then seek ye for death, if ye are sincere."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
But they will never seek for death, on account of the (sins) which their
 hands have sent on before them.
 and Allah is well-acquainted with the wrong-doers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Thou wilt indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life,-even more
 than the idolaters: Each one of them wishes He could be given a life of
 a thousand years: But the grant of such life will not save him from (due)
 punishment.
 For Allah sees well all that they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel-for he brings down the (revelation)
 to thy heart by Allah's will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance
 and glad tidings for those who believe,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and
 Michael,- Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We have sent down to thee Manifest Signs (ayat); and none reject them but
 those who are perverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among
 them throw it aside?- Nay, Most of them are faithless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what was
 with them, a party of the people of the Book threw away the Book of Allah
 behind their backs, as if (it had been something) they did not know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of
 Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching
 men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut
 and Marut.
 But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: "We are
 only for trial; so do not blaspheme." They learned from them the means to
 sow discord between man and wife.
 But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission.
 And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them.
 And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness
 of the Hereafter.
 And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but
 knew!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If they had kept their Faith and guarded themselves from evil, far better
 had been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
O ye of Faith! Say not (to the Messenger) words of ambiguous import, but
 words of respect; and hearken (to him): To those without Faith is a grievous
 punishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is never the wish of those without Faith among the People of the Book,
 nor of the Pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your
 Lord.
 But Allah will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is
 Lord of grace abounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 If it is a man that dies, leaving a sister but no child, she shall have

 Her brother takes her inheritance: If there are two sisters, they shall

 But when ye are clear of the sacred precincts and of pilgrim garb, ye may
 hunt and let not the hatred of some people in (once) shutting you out of
 the Sacred Mosque lead you to transgression (and hostility on your part).
 Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another

Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and

 a wild animal; unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due form); that which
 is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat)
 by raffling with arrows: that is impiety.
 This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion:
 yet fear them not but fear Me.
 This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon

 it: and fear Allah; for Allah is swift in taking account.

 But if ye are ill, or on a journey, or one of you cometh from offices of

Such were the towns whose story We (thus) relate unto thee: There came indeed
 to them their messengers with clear (signs): But they would not believe
 what they had rejected before.
 Thus doth Allah seal up the hearts of those who reject faith.

\begin_layout Standard
Most of them We found not men (true) to their covenant: but most of them
 We found rebellious and disobedient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs,
 but they wrongfully rejected them: So see what was the end of those who
 made mischief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "O Pharaoh! I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One for whom it is right to say nothing but truth about Allah.
 Now have I come unto you (people), from your Lord, with a clear (Sign):
 So let the Children of Israel depart along with me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "If indeed thou hast come with a Sign, show it forth,- if
 thou tellest the truth."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then (Moses) threw his rod, and behold! it was a serpent, plain (for all
 to see)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white to all beholders!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said the Chiefs of the people of Pharaoh: "This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"His plan is to get you out of your land: then what is it ye counsel?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while); and send
 to the cities men to collect-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there came the sorcerers to Pharaoh: They said, "of course we shall have
 a (suitable) reward if we win!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts)
 nearest (to my person)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "O Moses! wilt thou throw (first), or shall we have the (first)
 throw?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said Moses: "Throw ye (first)." So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes
 of the people, and struck terror into them: for they showed a great (feat
 of) magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We put it into Moses's mind by inspiration: "Throw (now) thy rod": and behold!
 it swallows up straight away all the falsehoods which they fake!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the (great ones) were vanquished there and then, and were made to look
 small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the sorcerers fell down prostrate in adoration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,-

\begin_layout Standard
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."

\begin_layout Standard
Said Pharaoh: "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely this
 is a trick which ye have planned in the city to drive out its people: but
 soon shall ye know (the consequences).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on apposite sides, and
 I will cause you all to die on the cross."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "For us, We are but sent back unto our Lord:

\begin_layout Standard
"But thou dost wreak thy vengeance on us simply because we believed in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people: "Wilt thou leave Moses and his people,
 to spread mischief in the land, and to abandon thee and thy gods?" He said:
 "Their male children will we slay; (only) their females will we save alive;
 and we have over them (power) irresistible."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said Moses to his people: "Pray for help from Allah, and (wait) in patience

 of His servants as He pleaseth; and the end is (best) for the righteous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "We have had (nothing but) trouble, both before and after thou
 camest to us." He said: "It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy
 and make you inheritors in the earth; that so He may try you by your deeds."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We punished the people of Pharaoh with years (of droughts) and shortness
 of crops; that they might receive admonition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when good (times) came, they said, "This is due to us;" When gripped
 by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those
 with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah's sight,
 but most of them do not understand!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said (to Moses): "Whatever be the Signs thou bringest, to work therewith
 thy sorcery on us, we shall never believe in thee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We sent (plagues) on them: Wholesale death, Locusts, Lice, Frogs, And
 Blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance,-
 a people given to sin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every time the penalty fell on them, they said: "O Moses! on your behalf
 call on thy Lord in virtue of his promise to thee: If thou wilt remove
 the penalty from us, we shall truly believe in thee, and we shall send
 away the Children of Israel with thee."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term
 which they had to fulfil,- Behold! they broke their word!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We exacted retribution from them: We drowned them in the sea, because
 they rejected Our Signs and failed to take warning from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We made a people, considered weak (and of no account), inheritors of
 lands in both east and west, - lands whereon We sent down Our blessings.
 The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel,
 because they had patience and constancy, and We levelled to the ground
 the great works and fine buildings which Pharaoh and his people erected
 (with such pride).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We took the Children of Israel (with safety) across the sea.
 They came upon a people devoted entirely to some idols they had.
 They said: "O Moses! fashion for us a god like unto the gods they have."
 He said: "Surely ye are a people without knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As to these folk,- the cult they are in is (but) a fragment of a ruin,

He said: "Shall I seek for you a god other than the (true) Allah, when it
 is Allah Who hath endowed you with gifts above the nations?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh's people, who afflicted you with
 the worst of penalties, who slew your male children and saved alive your

\begin_layout Standard
We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten
 (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty
 nights.
 And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): "Act for me
 amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Lord addressed him,
 He said: "O my Lord! show (Thyself) to me, that I may look upon thee." Allah
 said: "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount;
 if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me." When his Lord manifested
 His glory on the Mount, He made it as dust.
 And Moses fell down in a swoon.
 When he recovered his senses he said: "Glory be to Thee! to Thee I turn
 in repentance, and I am the first to believe."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Allah) said: "O Moses! I have chosen thee above (other) men, by the mission

And We ordained laws for him in the tablets in all matters, both commanding

 I show you the homes of the wicked,- (How they lie desolate)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right - them will
 I turn away from My signs: Even if they see all the signs, they will not
 believe in them; and if they see the way of right conduct, they will not
 adopt it as the way; but if they see the way of error, that is the way
 they will adopt.
 For they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them.

Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter,- vain are their

\begin_layout Standard
The people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the image
 of calf, (for worship): it seemed to low: did they not see that it could
 neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship
 and they did wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said: "If our Lord
 have not mercy upon us and forgive us, we shall indeed be of those who
 perish."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Moses came back to his people, angry and grieved, he said: "Evil it
 is that ye have done in my place in my absence: did ye make haste to bring
 on the judgment of your Lord?" He put down the tablets, seized his brother
 by (the hair of) his head, and dragged him to him.
 Aaron said: "Son of my mother! the people did indeed reckon me as naught,
 and went near to slaying me! Make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune,
 nor count thou me amongst the people of sin."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses prayed: "O my Lord! forgive me and my brother! admit us to Thy mercy!
 for Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who took the calf (for worship) will indeed be overwhelmed with wrath
 from their Lord, and with shame in this life: thus do We recompense those

But those who do wrong but repent thereafter and (truly) believe,- verily
 thy Lord is thereafter Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

\begin_layout Standard
When the anger of Moses was appeased, he took up the tablets: in the writing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our place of meeting: when they
 were seized with violent quaking, he prayed: "O my Lord! if it had been
 Thy will Thou couldst have destroyed, long before, both them and me: wouldst
 Thou destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? this is no
 more than Thy trial: by it Thou causest whom Thou wilt to stray, and Thou

"And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the Hereafter:

 impure); He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that
 are upon them.
 So it is those who believe in him, honour him, help him, and follow the

We divided them into twelve tribes or nations.
 We directed Moses by inspiration, when his (thirsty) people asked him for
 water: "Strike the rock with thy staff": out of it there gushed forth twelve
 springs: Each group knew its own place for water.
 We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails,
 (saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you": (but they
 rebelled); to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own souls.

And remember it was said to them: "Dwell in this town and eat therein as

But the transgressors among them changed the word from that which had been

 For that they repeatedly transgressed.

Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea.
 Behold! they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath.
 For on the day of their Sabbath their fish did come to them, openly holding

 did We make a trial of them, for they were given to transgression.

\begin_layout Standard
When some of them said: "Why do ye preach to a people whom Allah will destroy
 or visit with a terrible punishment?"- said the preachers:" To discharge
 our duty to your Lord, and perchance they may fear Him."

When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We rescued
 those who forbade Evil; but We visited the wrong-doers with a grievous
 punishment because they were given to transgression.

When in their insolence they transgressed (all) prohibitions, We said to

After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but
 they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse):
 "(Everything) will be forgiven us." (Even so), if similar vanities came
 their way, they would (again) seize them.
 Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe
 to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book.
 But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter.
 Will ye not understand?

As to those who hold fast by the Book and establish regular prayer,- never

When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they

When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins -

If it had been Our will, We should have elevated him with Our signs; but

 His similitude is that of a dog: if you attack him, he lolls out his tongue,

 That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs; So relate the story;

But when He giveth them a goodly child, they ascribe to others a share in

 As to those who believed but came not into exile, ye owe no duty of protection
 to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion,
 it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have
 a treaty of mutual alliance.
 And (remember) Allah seeth all that ye do.

Those who believe, and adopt exile, and fight for the Faith, in the cause

 If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye

(But the treaties are) not dissolved with those Pagans with whom ye have

But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever
 ye find them, an seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in

 Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that

 That is because they are men without knowledge.

How can there be a league, before Allah and His Messenger, with the Pagans,

 the righteous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How (can there be such a league), seeing that if they get an advantage over
 you, they respect not in you the ties either of kinship or of covenant?
 With (fair words from) their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are
 averse from you; and most of them are rebellious and wicked.
\end_layout

The Signs of Allah have they sold for a miserable price, and (many) have

In a Believer they respect not the ties either of kinship or of covenant!
 It is they who have transgressed all bounds.

But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and taunt you for

Will ye not fight people who violated their oaths, plotted to expel the

 Do ye fear them? Nay, it is Allah Whom ye should more justly fear, if ye

Or think ye that ye shall be abandoned, as though Allah did not know those

The mosques of Allah shall be visited and maintained by such as believe

Do ye make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred

 do wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who believe, and suffer exile and strive with might and main, in Allah's

Assuredly Allah did help you in many battle-fields and on the day of Hunain:
 Behold! your great numbers elated you, but they availed you naught: the

 retreat.
\end_layout

But Allah did pour His calm on the Messenger and on the Believers, and sent

\begin_layout Standard
They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation

The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year)- so ordained

 But know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily the transposing (of a prohibited month) is an addition to Unbelief:
 the Unbelievers are led to wrong thereby: for they make it lawful one year,

 The evil of their course seems pleasing to them.
 But Allah guideth not those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to

If ye help not (your leader), (it is no matter): for Allah did indeed help

 they two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, "Have no fear,
 for Allah is with us": then Allah sent down His peace upon him, and strengthene

 But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights: for Allah is Exalted in

Go ye forth, (whether equipped) lightly or heavily, and strive and struggle,

If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they
 would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long,

 They would indeed swear by Allah, "If we only could, we should certainly

If they had intended to come out, they would certainly have made some preparatio

\begin_layout Standard
If they had come out with you, they would not have added to your (strength)

 But Allah knoweth well those who do wrong.

Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for thee, until,-

"O Joseph!" (he said) "O man of truth! Expound to us (the dream) of seven

So the king said: "Bring ye him unto me." But when the messenger came to

\begin_layout Standard
(The king) said (to the ladies): "What was your affair when ye did seek

Thus did We give established power to Joseph in the land, to take possession

Then came Joseph's brethren: they entered his presence, and he knew them,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for them,
 he said: "Bring unto me a brother ye have, of the same father as yourselves,
 (but a different mother): see ye not that I pay out full measure, and that
 I do provide the best hospitality?
\end_layout

"Now if ye bring him not to me, ye shall have no measure (of corn) from

\begin_layout Standard
And (Joseph) told his servants to put their stock-in-trade (with which they

 they returned to their people, in order that they might come back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when they returned to their father, they said: "O our father! No more
 measure of grain shall we get (unless we take our brother): So send our
 brother with us, that we may get our measure; and we will indeed take every
 care of him."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Shall I trust you with him with any result other than when I trusted

 him), and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then when they opened their baggage, they found their stock-in-trade had
 been returned to them.
 They said: "O our father! What (more) can we desire? this our stock-in-trade
 has been returned to us: so we shall get (more) food for our family; We
 shall take care of our brother; and add (at the same time) a full camel's

 This is but a small quantity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Jacob) said: "Never will I send him with you until ye swear a solemn oath

 And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: "Over all that we say,
 be Allah the witness and guardian!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further he said: "O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different
 gates.
 Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can
 command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust
 put their trust on Him."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not
 profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity
 of Jacob's soul, which he discharged.
 For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but
 most men know not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when they came into Joseph's presence, he received his (full) brother
 to stay with him.
 He said (to him): "Behold! I am thy (own) brother; so grieve not at aught
 of their doings."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length when he had furnished them forth with provisions (suitable) for
 them, he put the drinking cup into his brother's saddle-bag.
 Then shouted out a crier: "O ye (in) the caravan! behold! ye are thieves,
 without doubt!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, turning towards them: "What is it that ye miss?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it,
 is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The brothers) said: "By Allah! well ye know that we came not to make mischief
 in the land, and we are no thieves!"

\begin_layout Standard
(The Egyptians) said: "What then shall be the penalty of this, if ye are
 (proved) to have lied?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found,
 should be held (as bondman) to atone for the (crime).
 Thus it is we punish the wrong-doers!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he began (the search) with their baggage, before (he came to) the baggage
 of his brother: at length he brought it out of his brother's baggage.
 Thus did We plan for Joseph.
 He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that Allah
 willed it (so).
 We raise to degrees (of wisdom) whom We please: but over all endued with
 knowledge is one, the All-Knowing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his who did steal before
 (him)." But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, revealing
 not the secrets to them.
 He (simply) said (to himself): "Ye are the worse situated; and Allah knoweth
 best the truth of what ye assert!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "O exalted one! Behold! he has a father, aged and venerable,
 (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place; for we see that
 thou art (gracious) in doing good."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Allah forbid that we take other than him with whom we found our
 property: indeed (if we did so), we should be acting wrongfully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when they saw no hope of his (yielding), they held a conference in private.
 The leader among them said: "Know ye not that your father did take an oath
 from you in Allah's name, and how, before this, ye did fail in your duty
 with Joseph? Therefore will I not leave this land until my father permits
 me, or Allah commands me; and He is the best to command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Turn ye back to your father, and say, 'O our father! behold! thy son committed

"'Ask at the town where we have been and the caravan in which we returned,

Jacob said: "Nay, but ye have yourselves contrived a story (good enough)

 So patience is most fitting (for me).
 Maybe Allah will bring them (back) all to me (in the end).
 For He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he turned away from them, and said: "How great is my grief for Joseph!"
 And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silent melancholy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "By Allah! (never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou
 reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!"
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when they came (back) into (Joseph's) presence they said: "O exalted
 one! distress has seized us and our family: we have (now) brought but scanty
 capital: so pay us full measure, (we pray thee), and treat it as charity
 to us: for Allah doth reward the charitable."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Know ye how ye dealt with Joseph and his brother, not knowing
 (what ye were doing)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Art thou indeed Joseph?" He said, "I am Joseph, and this is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "By Allah! indeed has Allah preferred thee above us, and we certainly

When the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: "I do indeed scent the

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "By Allah! truly thou art in thine old wandering mind."

And he raised his parents high on the throne (of dignity), and they fell

Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, who hinder

We sent not a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people,

We sent Moses with Our signs (and the command).

Remember! Moses said to his people: "Call to mind the favour of Allah to
 you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: they set you hard
 tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons, and let your women-folk live:
 therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord."
\end_layout

And remember! your Lord caused to be declared (publicly): "If ye are grateful,
 I will add more (favours) unto you; But if ye show ingratitude, truly My
 punishment is terrible indeed."

Has not the story reached you, (O people!), of those who (went) before you?
 - of the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud? - And of those who (came)
 after them? None knows them but Allah.
 To them came messengers with Clear (Signs); but they put their hands up
 to their mouths, and said: "We do deny (the mission) on which ye have been
 sent, and we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to
 which ye invite us."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their messengers said: "Is there a doubt about Allah, The Creator of the
 heavens and the earth? It is He Who invites you, in order that He may forgive
 you your sins and give you respite for a term appointed!" They said: "Ah!
 ye are no more than human, like ourselves! Ye wish to turn us away from
 the (gods) our fathers used to worship: then bring us some clear authority."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their messengers said to them: "True, we are human like yourselves, but
 Allah doth grant His grace to such of his servants as He pleases.
 It is not for us to bring you an authority except as Allah permits.
 And on Allah let all men of faith put their trust.
\end_layout

"No reason have we why we should not put our trust on Allah.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Unbelievers said to their messengers: "Be sure we shall drive you
 out of our land, or ye shall return to our religion." But their Lord inspired
 (this Message) to them: "Verily We shall cause the wrong-doers to perish!
\end_layout

The parable of those who reject their Lord is that their works are as ashes,

They will all be marshalled before Allah together: then will the weak say

 us to all against the wrath of Allah?" They will reply, "If we had received
 the Guidance of Allah, we should have given it to you: to us it makes no
 difference (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience:
 for ourselves there is no way of escape."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Satan will say when the matter is decided: "It was Allah Who gave you
 a promise of Truth: I too promised, but I failed in my promise to you.
 I had no authority over you except to call you but ye listened to me: then
 reproach not me, but reproach your own souls.
 I cannot listen to your cries, nor can ye listen to mine.
 I reject your former act in associating me with Allah.
 For wrong-doers there must be a grievous penalty."

Allah sets forth (another) Parable of two men: one of them dumb, with no

That is their recompense, because they rejected Our signs, and said, "When

Thou wouldst have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from

\begin_layout Standard
Thou wouldst have deemed them awake, whilst they were asleep, and We turned

Such (being their state), we raised them up (from sleep), that they might
 question each other.
 Said one of them, "How long have ye stayed (here)?" They said, "We have
 stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day." (At length) they (all) said,
 "Allah (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here....
 Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him

Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that
 the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the

 Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair.
 (Some) said, "Construct a building over them": Their Lord knows best about

(Some) say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them; (others)

 Say thou: "My Lord knoweth best their number; It is but few that know their

And keep thy soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and

\begin_layout Standard
Set forth to them the parable of two men: for one of them We provided two
 gardens of grape-vines and surrounded them with date palms; in between
 the two We placed corn-fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of those gardens brought forth its produce, and failed not in the least
 therein: in the midst of them We caused a river to flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Abundant) was the produce this man had: he said to his companion, in the
 course of a mutual argument: "more wealth have I than you, and more honour
 and power in (my following of) men."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He went into his garden in a state (of mind) unjust to his soul: He said,
 "I deem not that this will ever perish,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nor do I deem that the Hour (of Judgment) will (ever) come: Even if I am
 brought back to my Lord, I shall surely find (there) something better in
 exchange."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His companion said to him, in the course of the argument with him: "Dost
 thou deny Him Who created thee out of dust, then out of a sperm-drop, then
 fashioned thee into a man?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But (I think) for my part that He is Allah, My Lord, and none shall I associate

\begin_layout Standard
"Why didst thou not, as thou wentest into thy garden, say: 'Allah's will

"Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that thou wilt never

\begin_layout Standard
So his fruits (and enjoyment) were encompassed (with ruin), and he remained
 twisting and turning his hands over what he had spent on his property,
 which had (now) tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could
 only say, "Woe is me! Would I had never ascribed partners to my Lord and
 Cherisher!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor had he numbers to help him against Allah, nor was he able to deliver
 himself.

There, the (only) protection comes from Allah, the True One.
 He is the Best to reward, and the Best to give success.

\begin_layout Standard
Set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: It is like the

 (only) Allah who prevails over all things.
\end_layout

 great, but takes account thereof!" They will find all that they did, placed
 before them: And not one will thy Lord treat with injustice.

Behold! We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam": They bowed down except

 He was one of the Jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord.

\begin_layout Standard
And who doth more wrong than one who is reminded of the Signs of his Lord,

But when they reached the Junction, they forgot (about) their Fish, which
 took its course through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they had passed on (some distance), Moses said to his attendant: "Bring
 us our early meal; truly we have suffered much fatigue at this (stage of)
 our journey."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He replied: "Sawest thou (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the
 rock? I did indeed forget (about) the Fish: none but Satan made me forget
 to tell (you) about it: it took its course through the sea in a marvellous
 way!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "That was what we were seeking after:" So they went back on
 their footsteps, following (the path they had come).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they found one of Our servants, on whom We had bestowed Mercy from Ourselves
 and whom We had taught knowledge from Our own Presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said to him: "May I follow thee, on the footing that thou teach me
 something of the (Higher) Truth which thou hast been taught?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The other) said: "Verily thou wilt not be able to have patience with me!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding
 is not complete?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "Thou wilt find me, if Allah so will, (truly) patient: nor shall
 I disobey thee in aught."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other said: "If then thou wouldst follow me, ask me no questions about
 anything until I myself speak to thee concerning it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they both proceeded: until, when they were in the boat, he scuttled it.
 Said Moses: "Hast thou scuttled it in order to drown those in it? Truly
 a strange thing hast thou done!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with
 me?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "Rebuke me not for forgetting, nor grieve me by raising difficulties
 in my case."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they proceeded: until, when they met a young man, he slew him.
 Moses said: "Hast thou slain an innocent person who had slain none? Truly
 a foul (unheard of) thing hast thou done!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He answered: "Did I not tell thee that thou canst have no patience with
 me?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "If ever I ask thee about anything after this, keep me not
 in thy company: then wouldst thou have received (full) excuse from my side."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they proceeded: until, when they came to the inhabitants of a town,
 they asked them for food, but they refused them hospitality.
 They found there a wall on the point of falling down, but he set it up
 straight.
 (Moses) said: "If thou hadst wished, surely thou couldst have exacted some
 recompense for it!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He answered: "This is the parting between me and thee: now will I tell thee
 the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable to hold
 patience.

\begin_layout Standard
"As for the boat, it belonged to certain men in dire want: they plied on
 the water: I but wished to render it unserviceable, for there was after
 them a certain king who seized on every boat by force.

\begin_layout Standard
"As for the youth, his parents were people of Faith, and we feared that
 he would grieve them by obstinate rebellion and ingratitude (to Allah and
 man).

\begin_layout Standard
"So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange (a son) better
 in purity (of conduct) and closer in affection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans, in the Town; there
 was, beneath it, a buried treasure, to which they were entitled: their
 father had been a righteous man: So thy Lord desired that they should attain
 their age of full strength and get out their treasure - a mercy (and favour)
 from thy Lord.
 I did it not of my own accord.
 Such is the interpretation of (those things) over which thou wast unable

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One (such) way he followed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it set in a spring
 of murky water: Near it he found a People: We said: "O Zul-qarnain! (thou
 hast authority,) either to punish them, or to treat them with kindness."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Whoever doth wrong, him shall we punish; then shall he be sent
 back to his Lord; and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of (before).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But whoever believes, and works righteousness,- he shall have a goodly
 reward, and easy will be his task as We order it by our Command."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then followed he (another) way,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people
 for whom We had provided no covering protection against the sun.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(He left them) as they were: We completely understood what was before him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then followed he (another) way,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until, when he reached (a tract) between two mountains, he found, beneath
 them, a people who scarcely understood a word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "O Zul-qarnain! the Gog and Magog (People) do great mischief
 on earth: shall we then render thee tribute in order that thou mightest
 erect a barrier between us and them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "(The power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than
 tribute): Help me therefore with strength (and labour): I will erect a

"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when he had filled up the space between

 when he had made it (red) as fire, he said: "Bring me, that I may pour
 over it, molten lead."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus were they made powerless to scale it or to dig through it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that

(His prayer was answered): "O Zakariya! We give thee good news of a son:
 His name shall be Yahya: on none by that name have We conferred distinction

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and
 I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"

He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed

(Zakariya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer,
 "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights, although thou
 art not dumb."

\begin_layout Standard
So Zakariya came out to his people from him chamber: He told them by signs
 to celebrate Allah's praises in the morning and in the evening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(To his son came the command): "O Yahya! take hold of the Book with might":
 and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,

Man says: "What! When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive?"

So, by thy Lord, without doubt, We shall gather them together, and (also)

Then shall We certainly drag out from every sect all those who were worst

He said, "It is my rod: on it I lean; with it I beat down fodder for my

He threw it, and behold! It was a snake, active in motion.

\begin_layout Standard
"Behold! thy sister goeth forth and saith, 'shall I show you one who will
 nurse and rear the (child)?' So We brought thee back to thy mother, that
 her eye might be cooled and she should not grieve.
 Then thou didst slay a man, but We saved thee from trouble, and We tried
 thee in various ways.
 Then didst thou tarry a number of years with the people of Midian.
 Then didst thou come hither as ordained, O Moses!

"And I have prepared thee for Myself (for service)"..

They (Moses and Aaron) said: "Our Lord! We fear lest he hasten with insolence

He said: "Fear not: for I am with you: I hear and see (everything).

"So go ye both to him, and say, 'Verily we are messengers sent by thy Lord:

He said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to each (created) thing its form and nature,
 and further, gave (it) guidance."

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "What then is the condition of previous generations?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He replied: "The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded: my Lord
 never errs, nor forgets,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He Who has, made for you the earth like a carpet spread out; has enabled
 you to go about therein by roads (and channels); and has sent down water
 from the sky." With it have We produced diverse pairs of plants each separate

\begin_layout Standard
Eat (for yourselves) and pasture your cattle: verily, in this are Signs

\begin_layout Standard
And We showed Pharaoh all Our Signs, but he did reject and refuse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Hast thou come to drive us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But we can surely produce magic to match thine! So make a tryst between
 us and thee, which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor thou - in
 a place where both shall have even chances."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "Your tryst is the Day of the Festival, and let the people be
 assembled when the sun is well up."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Pharaoh withdrew: He concerted his plan, and then came (back).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said to him: Woe to you! Forge not ye a lie against Allah, lest He
 destroy you (at once) utterly by chastisement: the forger must suffer frustrati
on!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they disputed, one with another, over their affair, but they kept their
 talk secret.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "These two are certainly (expert) magicians: their object is
 to drive you out from your land with their magic, and to do away with your
 most cherished institutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Therefore concert your plan, and then assemble in (serried) ranks: He wins
 (all along) today who gains the upper hand."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "O Moses! whether wilt thou that thou throw (first) or that we
 be the first to throw?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said, "Nay, throw ye first!" Then behold their ropes and their rods-so
 it seemed to him on account of their magic - began to be in lively motion!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Moses conceived in his mind a (sort of) fear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We said: "Fear not! for thou hast indeed the upper hand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Throw that which is in thy right hand: Quickly will it swallow up that
 which they have faked what they have faked is but a magician's trick: and
 the magician thrives not, (no matter) where he goes."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the magicians were thrown down to prostration: they said, "We believe
 in the Lord of Aaron and Moses".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? Surely
 this must be your leader, who has taught you magic! be sure I will cut
 off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified
 on trunks of palm-trees: so shall ye know for certain, which of us can
 give the more severe and the more lasting punishment!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Never shall we regard thee as more than the Clear Signs that
 have come to us, or than Him Who created us! so decree whatever thou desirest
 to decree: for thou canst only decree (touching) the life of this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"For us, we have believed in our Lord: may He forgive us our faults, and
 the magic to which thou didst compel us: for Allah is Best and Most Abiding."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily he who comes to his Lord as a sinner (at Judgment),- for him is Hell:
 therein shall he neither die nor live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But such as come to Him as Believers who have worked righteous deeds,- for
 them are ranks exalted,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gardens of Eternity, beneath which flow rivers: they will dwell therein
 for aye: such is the reward of those who purify themselves (from evil).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sent an inspiration to Moses: "Travel by night with My servants, and
 strike a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken
 (by Pharaoh) and without (any other) fear."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters completely overwhelmed
 them and covered them up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O ye Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a
 Covenant with you on the right side of Mount (Sinai), and We sent down
 to you Manna and quails:

\begin_layout Standard
(Saying): "Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance,

\begin_layout Standard
"But, without doubt, I am (also) He that forgives again and again, to those

 true guidance."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(When Moses was up on the Mount, Allah said:) "What made thee hasten in
 advance of thy people, O Moses?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He replied: "Behold, they are close on my footsteps: I hastened to thee,
 O my Lord, to please thee."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Allah) said: "We have tested thy people in thy absence: the Samiri has
 led them astray."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Moses returned to his people in a state of indignation and sorrow.
 He said: "O my people! did not your Lord make a handsome promise to you?
 Did then the promise seem to you long (in coming)? Or did ye desire that
 Wrath should descend from your Lord on you, and so ye broke your promise
 to me?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "We broke not the promise to thee, as far as lay in our power:
 but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the (whole) people,
 and we threw them (into the fire), and that was what the Samiri suggested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Then he brought out (of the fire) before the (people) the image of a calf:
 It seemed to low: so they said: This is your god, and the god of Moses,
 but (Moses) has forgotten!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Could they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and
 that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aaron had already, before this said to them: "O my people! ye are being
 tested in this: for verily your Lord is (Allah) Most Gracious; so follow
 me and obey my command."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They had said: "We will not abandon this cult, but we will devote ourselves
 to it until Moses returns to us."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "O Aaron! what kept thee back, when thou sawest them going
 wrong,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"From following me? Didst thou then disobey my order?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Aaron) replied: "O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard nor by
 (the hair of) my head! Truly I feared lest thou shouldst say, 'Thou has
 caused a division among the children of Israel, and thou didst not respect
 my word!'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "What then is thy case, O Samiri?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He replied: "I saw what they saw not: so I took a handful (of dust) from
 the footprint of the Messenger, and threw it (into the calf): thus did
 my soul suggest to me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be
 that thou wilt say, 'touch me not'; and moreover (for a future penalty)
 thou hast a promise that will not fail: Now look at thy god, of whom thou
 hast become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly (melt) it in a blazing
 fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the god of you all is the One Allah: there is no god but He: all things
 He comprehends in His knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus do We relate to thee some stories of what happened before: for We have
 sent thee a Message from Our own Presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any do turn away therefrom, verily they will bear a burden on the Day
 of judgment;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will abide in this (state): and grievous will the burden be to them
 on that Day,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day when the Trumpet will be sounded: that Day, We shall gather the
 sinful, blear-eyed (with terror).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In whispers will they consult each other: "Yet tarried not longer than ten
 (Days);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know best what they will say, when their leader most eminent in conduct
 will say: "Ye tarried not longer than a day!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They ask thee concerning the Mountains: say, "My Lord will uproot them and
 scatter them as dust;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"He will leave them as plains smooth and level;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nothing crooked or curved wilt thou see in their place."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that Day will they follow the Caller (straight): no crookedness (can
 they show) him: all sounds shall humble themselves in the Presence of (Allah)
 Most Gracious: nothing shalt thou hear but the tramp of their feet (as
 they march).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that Day shall no intercession avail except for those for whom permission
 has been granted by (Allah) Most Gracious and whose word is acceptable
 to Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He knows what (appears to His creatures as) before or after or behind them:
 but they shall not compass it with their knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(All) faces shall be humbled before (Him) - the Living, the Self-Subsisting,
 Eternal: hopeless indeed will be the man that carries iniquity (on his
 back).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he who works deeds of righteousness, and has faith, will have no fear
 of harm nor of any curtailment (of what is his due).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus have We sent this down - an arabic Qur'an - and explained therein in
 detail some of the warnings, in order that they may fear Allah, or that
 it may cause their remembrance (of Him).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High above all is Allah, the King, the Truth! Be not in haste with the Qur'an
 before its revelation to thee is completed, but say, "O my Lord! advance
 me in knowledge."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We had already, beforehand, taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot: and
 We found on his part no firm resolve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam", they prostrated
 themselves, but not Iblis: he refused.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We said: "O Adam! verily, this is an enemy to thee and thy wife: so
 let him not get you both out of the Garden, so that thou art landed in
 misery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There is therein (enough provision) for thee not to go hungry nor to go
 naked,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Satan whispered evil to him: he said, "O Adam! shall I lead thee to
 the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the result, they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared
 to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the
 Garden: thus did Adam disobey his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But his Lord chose him (for His Grace): He turned to him, and gave him Guidance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Get ye down, both of you,- all together, from the Garden, with
 enmity one to another: but if, as is sure, there comes to you Guidance
 from Me, whosoever follows My Guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall
 into misery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But whosoever turns away from My Message, verily for him is a life narrowed
 down, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He will say: "O my Lord! why hast Thou raised me up blind, while I had sight
 (before)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Allah) will say: "Thus didst Thou, when Our Signs came unto thee, disregard
 them: so wilt thou, this day, be disregarded."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thus do We recompense him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes
 not in the Signs of his Lord: and the Penalty of the Hereafter is far more
 grievous and more enduring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "Have you brought us the Truth, or are you one of those who jest?"

So he broke them to pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might

They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be some man of
 impiety!"

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: He is called Abraham."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may
 bear witness."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Abraham?"

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them, if
 they can speak intelligently!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!"

\begin_layout Standard
Then were they confounded with shame: (they said), "Thou knowest full well

\begin_layout Standard
(Abraham) said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah, things that can neither

Then they sought a stratagem against him: but We made them the ones that

But We delivered him and (his nephew) Lut (and directed them) to the land
 which We have blessed for the nations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob,
 and We made righteous men of every one (of them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them
 inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise
 regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to Lut, too, We gave Judgment and Knowledge, and We saved him from the
 town which practised abominations: truly they were a people given to Evil,
 a rebellious people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We admitted him to Our Mercy: for he was one of the Righteous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime: We listened to his (prayer)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We helped him against people who rejected Our Signs: truly they were a people
 given to Evil: so We drowned them (in the Flood) all together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of
 the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night:
 We did witness their judgment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Solomon We inspired the (right) understanding of the matter: to each

 hills and the birds celebrate Our praises, with David: it was We Who did
 (all these things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to
 guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful?

(It was Our power that made) the violent (unruly) wind flow (tamely) for
 Solomon, to his order, to the land which We had blessed: for We do know
 all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of the evil ones, were some who dived for him, and did other work besides;
 and it was We Who guarded them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (remember) Job, when He cried to his Lord, "Truly distress has seized
 me, but Thou art the Most Merciful of those that are merciful."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We listened to him: We removed the distress that was on him, and We restored
 his people to him, and doubled their number,- as a Grace from Ourselves,
 and a thing for commemoration, for all who serve Us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Zul-kifl, all (men) of constancy and
 patience;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember Zun-nun, when he departed in wrath: He imagined that We had
 no power over him! But he cried through the deptHs of darkness, "There
 is no god but thou: glory to thee: I was indeed wrong!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We listened to him: and delivered him from distress: and thus do We deliver
 those who have faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: "O my Lord! leave me
 not without offspring, though thou art the best of inheritors."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We listened to him: and We granted him Yahya: We cured his wife's (Barrenness

 These (three) were ever quick in emulation in good works; they used to
 call on Us with love and reverence, and humble themselves before Us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (remember) her who guarded her chastity: We breathed into her of Our

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood, and I am your
 Lord and Cherisher: therefore serve Me (and no other).

But (later generations) cut off their affair (of unity), one from another:

\begin_layout Standard
Whoever works any act of righteousness and has faith,- His endeavour will

Until the Gog and Magog (people) are let through (their barrier), and they

\begin_layout Standard
Then will the true promise draw nigh (of fulfilment): then behold! the eyes

\begin_layout Standard
Verily ye, (unbelievers), and the (false) gods that ye worship besides Allah,

Those for whom the good (record) from Us has gone before, will be removed

Not the slightest sound will they hear of Hell: what their souls desired,

The Great Terror will bring them no grief: but the angels will meet them

\begin_layout Standard
Before this We wrote in the Psalms, after the Message (given to Moses):

O mankind! if ye have a doubt about the Resurrection, (consider) that We

 that We may manifest (our power) to you; and We cause whom We will to rest
 in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring you out as babes,
 then (foster you) that ye may reach your age of full strength; and some
 of you are called to die, and some are sent back to the feeblest old age,
 so that they know nothing after having known (much), and (further), thou

 it is stirred (to life), it swells, and it puts forth every kind of beautiful

There are among men some who serve Allah, as it were, on the verge: if good

 that is loss for all to see!

They call on such deities, besides Allah, as can neither hurt nor profit
 them: that is straying far indeed (from the Way)!

(Perhaps) they call on one whose hurt is nearer than his profit: evil, indeed,

 Will ye not fear (Him)?"

\begin_layout Standard
The chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "He is no more than

 if Allah had wished (to send messengers), He could have sent down angels;
 never did we hear such a thing (as he says), among our ancestors of old."

\begin_layout Standard
(And some said): "He is only a man possessed: wait (and have patience) with
 him for a time."

\begin_layout Standard
(Noah) said: "O my Lord! help me: for that they accuse me of falsehood!"

So We inspired him (with this message): "Construct the Ark within Our sight

 has already gone forth: And address Me not in favour of the wrong-doers;
 for they shall be drowned (in the Flood).

\begin_layout Standard
And when thou hast embarked on the Ark - thou and those with thee,- say:
 "Praise be to Allah, Who has saved us from the people who do wrong."

And say: "O my Lord! enable me to disembark with thy blessing: for Thou

\begin_layout Standard
Verily in this there are Signs (for men to understand); (thus) do We try

\begin_layout Standard
Then We raised after them another generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We sent to them a messenger from among themselves, (saying), "Worship

 Will ye not fear (Him)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the chiefs of his people, who disbelieved and denied the Meeting in
 the Hereafter, and on whom We had bestowed the good things of this life,
 said: "He is no more than a man like yourselves: he eats of that of which
 ye eat, and drinks of what ye drink.

\begin_layout Standard
"If ye obey a man like yourselves, behold, it is certain ye will be lost.

(Allah) said: "In but a little while, they are sure to be sorry!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the Blast overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubbish of
 dead leaves (floating on the stream of Time)! So away with the people who
 do wrong!

\begin_layout Standard
Then We raised after them other generations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No people can hasten their term, nor can they delay (it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then sent We our messengers in succession: every time there came to a people
 their messenger, they accused him of falsehood: so We made them follow
 each other (in punishment): We made them as a tale (that is told): So away
 with a people that will not believe!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our Signs and authority manifest,

To Pharaoh and his Chiefs: But these behaved insolently: they were an arrogant

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Shall we believe in two men like ourselves? And their people

\begin_layout Standard
So they accused them of falsehood, and they became of those who were destroyed.

\begin_layout Standard
And We gave Moses the Book, in order that they might receive guidance.

\begin_layout Standard
And We made the son of Mary and his mother as a Sign: We gave them both
 shelter on high ground, affording rest and security and furnished with

O ye messengers! enjoy (all) things good and pure, and work righteousness:

And verily this Brotherhood of yours is a single Brotherhood, and I am your

 these are your three times of undress: outside those times it is not wrong

Hast thou not turned thy vision to thy Lord?- How He doth prolong the shadow!
 If He willed, He could make it stationary! then do We make the sun its
 guide;

Then We draw it in towards Ourselves,- a contraction by easy stages.

And He it is Who makes the Night as a Robe for you, and Sleep as Repose,
 and makes the Day (as it were) a Resurrection.

\begin_layout Standard
And He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before
 His mercy, and We send down pure water from the sky,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That with it We may give life to a dead land, and slake the thirst of things
 We have created,- cattle and men in great numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have distributed the (water) amongst them, in order that they may
 celebrate (our) praises, but most men are averse (to aught) but (rank)
 ingratitude.

Had it been Our Will, We could have sent a warner to every centre of population.

Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the

\begin_layout Standard
It is He Who has let free the two bodies of flowing water: One palatable
 and sweet, and the other salt and bitter; yet has He made a barrier between
 them, a partition that is forbidden to be passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is He Who has created man from water: then has He established relationships
 of lineage and marriage: for thy Lord has power (over all things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet do they worship, besides Allah, things that can neither profit them

But thee We only sent to give glad tidings and admonition.

And put thy trust in Him Who lives and dies not; and celebrate his praise;
 and enough is He to be acquainted with the faults of His servants;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between, in six
 days, and is firmly established on the Throne (of Authority): Allah Most
 Gracious: ask thou, then, about Him of any acquainted (with such things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When it is said to them, "Prostrate to (Allah) Most Gracious!", they say,
 "And what is (Allah) Most Gracious? Shall we prostrate to that which thou
 commandest us?" And it increases their flight (from the Truth).

\begin_layout Standard
Blessed is He Who made constellations in the skies, and placed therein a
 Lamp and a Moon giving light;

\begin_layout Standard
And it is He Who made the Night and the Day to follow each other: for such
 as have the will to celebrate His praises or to show their gratitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the servants of (Allah) Most Gracious are those who walk on the earth
 in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they say, "Peace!";
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who spend the night in adoration of their Lord prostrate and standing;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who say, "Our Lord! avert from us the Wrath of Hell, for its Wrath
 is indeed an affliction grievous,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Evil indeed is it as an abode, and as a place to rest in";

\begin_layout Standard
Those who, when they spend, are not extravagant and not niggardly, but hold
 a just (balance) between those (extremes);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who invoke not, with Allah, any other god, nor slay such life as Allah
 has made sacred except for just cause, nor commit fornication; - and any
 that does this (not only) meets punishment.

\begin_layout Standard
(But) the Penalty on the Day of Judgment will be doubled to him, and he

Unless he repents, believes, and works righteous deeds, for Allah will change
 the evil of such persons into good, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah with an (acceptable)
 conversion;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass
 by it with honourable (avoidance);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who, when they are admonished with the Signs of their Lord, droop
 not down at them as if they were deaf or blind;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who pray, "Our Lord! Grant unto us wives and offspring who will
 be the comfort of our eyes, and give us (the grace) to lead the righteous."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those are the ones who will be rewarded with the highest place in heaven,
 because of their patient constancy: therein shall they be met with salutations
 and peace,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dwelling therein;- how beautiful an abode and place of rest!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say (to the Rejecters): "My Lord is not uneasy because of you if ye call

If (such) were Our Will, We could send down to them from the sky a Sign,
 to which they would bend their necks in humility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there comes not to them a newly-revealed Message from (Allah) Most Gracious,
 but they turn away therefrom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have indeed rejected (the Message): so they will know soon (enough)
 the truth of what they mocked at!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do they not look at the earth,- how many noble things of all kinds We have
 produced therein?

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.

Behold, thy Lord called Moses: "Go to the people of iniquity,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The people of the Pharaoh: will they not fear Allah?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my Lord! I do fear that they will charge me with falsehood:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"My breast will be straitened.
 And my speech may not go (smoothly): so send unto Aaron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And (further), they have a charge of crime against me; and I fear they
 may slay me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah said: "By no means! proceed then, both of you, with Our Signs; We
 are with you, and will listen (to your call).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So go forth, both of you, to Pharaoh, and say: 'We have been sent by the
 Lord and Cherisher of the worlds;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'Send thou with us the Children of Israel.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "Did we not cherish thee as a child among us, and didst
 thou not stay in our midst many years of thy life?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And thou didst a deed of thine which (thou knowest) thou didst, and thou
 art an ungrateful (wretch)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said: "I did it then, when I was in error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So I fled from you (all) when I feared you; but my Lord has (since) invested
 me with judgment (and wisdom) and appointed me as one of the messengers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And this is the favour with which thou dost reproach me,- that thou hast
 enslaved the Children of Israel!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pharaoh said: "And what is the 'Lord and Cherisher of the worlds'?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "The Lord and Cherisher of the heavens and the earth, and
 all between,- if ye want to be quite sure."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said to those around: "Did ye not listen (to what he says)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "Truly your messenger who has been sent to you is a veritable
 madman!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "Lord of the East and the West, and all between! if ye only
 had sense!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "If thou dost put forward any god other than me, I will
 certainly put thee in prison!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "Even if I showed you something clear (and) convincing?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said: "Show it then, if thou tellest the truth!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (Moses) threw his rod, and behold, it was a serpent, plain (for all to
 see)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs around him: "This is indeed a sorcerer well-versed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"His plan is to get you out of your land by his sorcery; then what is it
 ye counsel?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Keep him and his brother in suspense (for a while), and dispatch
 to the Cities heralds to collect-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And bring up to thee all (our) sorcerers well-versed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the sorcerers were got together for the appointment of a day well-known,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the people were told: "Are ye (now) assembled?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That we may follow the sorcerers (in religion) if they win?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Pharaoh: "Of course - shall
 we have a (suitable) reward if we win?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Yea, (and more),- for ye shall in that case be (raised to posts)
 nearest (to my person)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moses said to them: "Throw ye - that which ye are about to throw!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they threw their ropes and their rods, and said: "By the might of Pharaoh,
 it is we who will certainly win!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Moses threw his rod, when, behold, it straightway swallows up all the
 falsehoods which they fake!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did the sorcerers fall down, prostrate in adoration,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye in Him before I give you permission? surely
 he is your leader, who has taught you sorcery! but soon shall ye know!
 Be sure I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and
 I will cause you all to die on the cross!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "No matter! for us, we shall but return to our Lord!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Only, our desire is that our Lord will forgive us our faults, that we may
 become foremost among the believers!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By inspiration we told Moses: "Travel by night with my servants; for surely
 ye shall be pursued."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Pharaoh sent heralds to (all) the Cities,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Saying): "These (Israelites) are but a small band,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And they are raging furiously against us;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But we are a multitude amply fore-warned."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We expelled them from gardens, springs,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Treasures, and every kind of honourable position;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus it was, but We made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they pursued them at sunrise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the two bodies saw each other, the people of Moses said: "We are
 sure to be overtaken."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Moses) said: "By no means! my Lord is with me! Soon will He guide me!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We told Moses by inspiration: "Strike the sea with thy rod." So it divided,
 and each separate part became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We made the other party approach thither.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We delivered Moses and all who were with him;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We drowned the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.

\begin_layout Standard
And rehearse to them (something of) Abraham's story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, he said to his father and his people: "What worship ye?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on
 them."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Do they listen to you when ye call (on them)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Or do you good or harm?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping,-

He said: "And what do I know as to what they do?

"Judge Thou, then, between me and them openly, and deliver me and those

\begin_layout Standard
"O my Lord! deliver me and my family from such things as they do!"

So We delivered him and his family,- all

We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower

Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe.

\begin_layout Standard
The Companions of the Wood rejected the messengers.

Behold, Shu'aib said to them: "Will ye not fear (Allah)?

He said: "My Lord knows best what ye do."

But they rejected him.
 Then the punishment of a day of overshadowing gloom seized them, and that

Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds:

To thy heart and mind, that thou mayest admonish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the perspicuous Arabic tongue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without doubt it is (announced) in the mystic Books of former peoples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it not a Sign to them that the Learned of the Children of Israel knew
 it (as true)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had We revealed it to any of the non-Arabs,

\begin_layout Standard
And had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it.

\begin_layout Standard
Thus have We caused it to enter the hearts of the sinners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will not believe in it until they see the grievous Penalty;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the (Penalty) will come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it
 not;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they will say: "Shall we be respited?"

\begin_layout Standard
Do they then ask for Our Penalty to be hastened on?

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou? If We do let them enjoy (this life) for a few years,

No evil ones have brought down this (Revelation):

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed they have been removed far from even (a chance of) hearing it.

\begin_layout Standard
So call not on any other god with Allah, or thou wilt be among those under
 the Penalty.

And admonish thy nearest kinsmen,

\begin_layout Standard

Those who establish regular prayers and give in regular charity, and also
 have (full) assurance of the hereafter.

\begin_layout Standard
As to those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made their deeds pleasing

Behold! Moses said to his family: "I perceive a fire; soon will I bring
 you from there some information, or I will bring you a burning brand to
 light our fuel, that ye may warm yourselves.

\begin_layout Standard
But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard: "Blessed are those in

\begin_layout Standard
"O Moses! verily, I am Allah, the exalted in might, the wise!....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Now do thou throw thy rod!" But when he saw it moving (of its own accord)
 as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and retraced not
 his steps: "O Moses!" (it was said), "Fear not: truly, in My presence,
 those called as messengers have no fear,-

\begin_layout Standard
But when Our Signs came to them, that should have opened their eyes, they
 said: "This is sorcery manifest!"

\begin_layout Standard
And they rejected those Signs in iniquity and arrogance, though their souls
 were convinced thereof: so see what was the end of those who acted corruptly!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We gave (in the past) knowledge to David and Solomon: And they both said:
 "Praise be to Allah, Who has favoured us above many of his servants who
 believe!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Solomon was David's heir.
 He said: "O ye people! We have been taught the speech of birds, and on
 us has been bestowed (a little) of all things: this is indeed Grace manifest
 (from Allah.)"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of Jinns and men and birds,
 and they were all kept in order and ranks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said:
 "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush
 you (under foot) without knowing it."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order me
 that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me
 and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please
 Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he took a muster of the Birds; and he said: "Why is it I see not the
 Hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I will certainly punish him with a severe penalty, or execute him, unless
 he bring me a clear reason (for absence)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Hoopoe tarried not far: he (came up and) said: "I have compassed
 (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from
 Saba with tidings true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I found (there) a woman ruling over them and provided with every requisite;

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I found her and her people worshipping the sun besides Allah: Satan has

\begin_layout Standard
"(Kept them away from the Path), that they should not worship Allah, Who

\begin_layout Standard
"Allah!- there is no god but He!- Lord of the Throne Supreme!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Solomon) said: "Soon shall we see whether thou hast told the truth or lied!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Go thou, with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them: then draw back
 from them, and (wait to) see what answer they return"...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The queen) said: "Ye chiefs! here is delivered to me - a letter worthy
 of respect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is from Solomon, and is (as follows): 'In the name of Allah, Most Gracious,
 Most Merciful:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'Be ye not arrogant against me, but come to me in submission (to the true
 Religion).'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She said: "Ye chiefs! advise me in (this) my affair: no affair have I decided
 except in your presence."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "We are endued with strength, and given to vehement war: but
 the command is with thee; so consider what thou wilt command."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She said: "Kings, when they enter a country, despoil it, and make the noblest
 of its people its meanest thus do they behave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But I am going to send him a present, and (wait) to see with what (answer)
 return (my) ambassadors."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when (the embassy) came to Solomon, he said: "Will ye give me abundance
 in wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which
 He has given you! Nay it is ye who rejoice in your gift!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Go back to them, and be sure we shall come to them with such hosts as they
 will never be able to meet: We shall expel them from there in disgrace,
 and they will feel humbled (indeed)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said (to his own men): "Ye chiefs! which of you can bring me her throne
 before they come to me in submission?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said an 'Ifrit, of the Jinns: "I will bring it to thee before thou rise
 from thy council: indeed I have full strength for the purpose, and may
 be trusted."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said one who had knowledge of the Book: "I will bring it to thee within
 the twinkling of an eye!" Then when (Solomon) saw it placed firmly before
 him, he said: "This is by the Grace of my Lord!- to test me whether I am
 grateful or ungrateful! and if any is grateful, truly his gratitude is
 (a gain) for his own soul; but if any is ungrateful, truly my Lord is Free
 of all Needs, Supreme in Honour!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Transform her throne out of all recognition by her: let us see
 whether she is guided (to the truth) or is one of those who receive no
 guidance."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when she arrived, she was asked, "Is this thy throne?" She said, "It
 was just like this; and knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this,
 and we have submitted to Allah (in Islam)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he diverted her from the worship of others besides Allah: for she was
 (sprung) of a people that had no faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was asked to enter the lofty Palace: but when she saw it, she thought
 it was a lake of water, and she (tucked up her skirts), uncovering her
 legs.
 He said: "This is but a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass." She said:
 "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul: I do (now) submit (in Islam),
 with Solomon, to the Lord of the Worlds."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sent (aforetime), to the Thamud, their brother Salih, saying, "Serve
 Allah": But behold, they became two factions quarrelling with each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my people! why ask ye to hasten on the evil in preference to
 the good? If only ye ask Allah for forgiveness, ye may hope to receive
 mercy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Ill omen do we augur from thee and those that are with thee".
 He said: "Your ill omen is with Allah; yea, ye are a people under trial."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were in the city nine men of a family, who made mischief in the land,
 and would not reform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Swear a mutual oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night
 attack on him and his people, and that we shall then say to his heir (when
 he seeks vengeance): 'We were not present at the slaughter of his people,
 and we are positively telling the truth.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They plotted and planned, but We too planned, even while they perceived
 it not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then see what was the end of their plot!- this, that We destroyed them and
 their people, all (of them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now such were their houses, - in utter ruin, - because they practised wrong-doin
g.
 Verily in this is a Sign for people of knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We saved those who believed and practised righteousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(We also sent) Lut (as a messenger): behold, He said to his people, "Do
 ye do what is shameful though ye see (its iniquity)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are
 a people (grossly) ignorant!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But his people gave no other answer but this: they said, "Drive out the
 followers of Lut from your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean
 and pure!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We saved him and his family, except his wife; her We destined to be
 of those who lagged behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower
 on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: Praise be to Allah, and Peace on his servants whom He has chosen (for
 his Message).
 (Who) is better?- Allah or the false gods they associate (with Him)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, Who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who sends you down rain
 from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow well-planted orchards full
 of beauty of delight: it is not in your power to cause the growth of the
 trees in them.
 (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay, they are a people who swerve
 from justice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, Who has made the earth firm to live in; made rivers in its midst; set
 thereon mountains immovable; and made a separating bar between the two
 bodies of flowing water? (can there be another) god besides Allah? Nay,
 most of them know not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, Who listens to the (soul) distressed when it calls on Him, and Who relieves
 its suffering, and makes you (mankind) inheritors of the earth? (Can there
 be another) god besides Allah? Little it is that ye heed!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, Who guides you through the depths of darkness on land and sea, and Who
 sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy? (Can
 there be another) god besides Allah?- High is Allah above what they associate
 with Him!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, Who originates creation, then repeats it, and who gives you sustenance
 from heaven and earth? (Can there be another) god besides Allah? Say, "Bring
 forth your argument, if ye are telling the truth!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: None in the heavens or on earth, except Allah, knows what is hidden:
 nor can they perceive when they shall be raised up (for Judgment).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still less can their knowledge comprehend the Hereafter: Nay, they are in
 doubt and uncertainty thereanent; nay, they are blind thereunto!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Unbelievers say: "What! when we become dust,- we and our fathers,- shall
 we really be raised (from the dead)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It is true we were promised this,- we and our fathers before (us): these
 are nothing but tales of the ancients."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "Go ye through the earth and see what has been the end of those guilty

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But grieve not over them, nor distress thyself because of their plots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They also say: "When will this promise (come to pass)? (Say) if ye are truthful."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "It may be that some of the events which ye wish to hasten on may be
 (close) in your pursuit!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But verily thy Lord is full of grace to mankind: Yet most of them are ungrateful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And verily thy Lord knoweth all that their hearts do hide.
 As well as all that they reveal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor is there aught of the unseen, in heaven or earth, but is (recorded)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily this Qur'an doth explain to the Children of Israel most of the matters
 in which they disagree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And it certainly is a Guide and a Mercy to those who believe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily thy Lord will decide between them by His Decree: and He is Exalted
 in Might, All-Knowing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So put thy trust in Allah: for thou art on (the path of) manifest Truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst thou cause the
 deaf to hear the call, (especially) when they turn back in retreat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor canst thou be a guide to the blind, (to prevent them) from straying:
 only those wilt thou get to listen who believe in Our Signs, and they will
 bow in Islam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall produce
 from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them, for that
 mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day We shall gather together from every people a troop of those who
 reject our Signs, and they shall be kept in ranks,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until, when they come (before the Judgment-seat), (Allah) will say: "Did
 ye reject My Signs, though ye comprehended them not in knowledge, or what
 was it ye did?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrong-doing,
 and they will be unable to speak (in plea).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See they not that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day
 to give them light? Verily in this are Signs for any people that believe!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Day that the Trumpet will be sounded - then will be smitten with
 terror those who are in the heavens, and those who are on earth, except
 such as Allah will please (to exempt): and all shall come to His (Presence)
 as beings conscious of their lowliness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thou seest the mountains and thinkest them firmly fixed: but they shall
 pass away as the clouds pass away: (such is) the artistry of Allah, who
 disposes of all things in perfect order: for he is well acquainted with
 all that ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any do good, good will (accrue) to them therefrom; and they will be secure
 from terror that Day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if any do evil, their faces will be thrown headlong into the Fire: "Do
 ye receive a reward other than that which ye have earned by your deeds?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who has
 sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be
 of those who bow in Islam to Allah's Will,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to rehearse the Qur'an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the
 good of their own souls, and if any stray, say: "I am only a Warner".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And say: "Praise be to Allah, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that
 ye shall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ta.
 Sin.
 Mim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are Verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We rehearse to thee some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in Truth, for
 people who believe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly Pharaoh elated himself in the land and broke up its people into sections,
 depressing a small group among them: their sons he slew, but he kept alive
 their females: for he was indeed a maker of mischief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We wished to be Gracious to those who were being depressed in the land,
 to make them leaders (in Faith) and make them heirs,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish a firm place for them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman,
 and their hosts, at their hands, the very things against which they were
 taking precautions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle (thy child),
 but when thou hast fears about him, cast him into the river, but fear not
 nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one
 of Our messengers."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the people of Pharaoh picked him up (from the river): (It was intended)
 that (Moses) should be to them an adversary and a cause of sorrow: for
 Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were men of sin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wife of Pharaoh said: "(Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee:
 slay him not.
 It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And
 they perceived not (what they were doing)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there came to be a void in the heart of the mother of Moses: She was
 going almost to disclose his (case), had We not strengthened her heart
 (with faith), so that she might remain a (firm) believer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And she said to the sister of (Moses), "Follow him" so she (the sister)
 watched him in the character of a stranger.
 And they knew not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we ordained that he refused suck at first, until (His sister came up
 and) said: "Shall I point out to you the people of a house that will nourish
 and bring him up for you and be sincerely attached to him?"...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus did We restore him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted,
 that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of
 Allah is true: but most of them do not understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he reached full age, and was firmly established (in life), We bestowed
 on him wisdom and knowledge: for thus do We reward those who do good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching: and
 he found there two men fighting,- one of his own religion, and the other,
 of his foes.
 Now the man of his own religion appealed to him against his foe, and Moses
 struck him with his fist and made an end of him.
 He said: "This is a work of Evil (Satan): for he is an enemy that manifestly
 misleads!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He prayed: "O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul! Do Thou then forgive
 me!" So (Allah) forgave him: for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my Lord! For that Thou hast bestowed Thy Grace on me, never
 shall I be a help to those who sin!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he saw the morning in the city, looking about, in a state of fear, when
 behold, the man who had, the day before, sought his help called aloud for
 his help (again).
 Moses said to him: "Thou art truly, it is clear, a quarrelsome fellow!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when he decided to lay hold of the man who was an enemy to both of
 them, that man said: "O Moses! Is it thy intention to slay me as thou slewest
 a man yesterday? Thy intention is none other than to become a powerful
 violent man in the land, and not to be one who sets things right!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there came a man, running, from the furthest end of the City.
 He said: "O Moses! the Chiefs are taking counsel together about thee, to
 slay thee: so get thee away, for I do give thee sincere advice."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He therefore got away therefrom, looking about, in a state of fear.
 He prayed "O my Lord! save me from people given to wrong-doing."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when he turned his face towards (the land of) Madyan, he said: "I
 do hope that my Lord will show me the smooth and straight Path."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when he arrived at the watering (place) in Madyan, he found there a
 group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women
 who were keeping back (their flocks).
 He said: "What is the matter with you?" They said: "We cannot water (our
 flocks) until the shepherds take back (their flocks): And our father is
 a very old man."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade,
 and said:"O my Lord! truly am I in (desperate) need of any good that Thou
 dost send me!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afterwards one of the (damsels) came (back) to him, walking bashfully.
 She said: "My father invites thee that he may reward thee for having watered
 (our flocks) for us." So when he came to him and narrated the story, he
 said: "Fear thou not: (well) hast thou escaped from unjust people."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Said one of the (damsels): "O my (dear) father! engage him on wages: truly
 the best of men for thee to employ is the (man) who is strong and trusty"....
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "I intend to wed one of these my daughters to thee, on condition
 that thou serve me for eight years; but if thou complete ten years, it
 will be (grace) from thee.
 But I intend not to place thee under a difficulty: thou wilt find me, indeed,
 if Allah wills, one of the righteous."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Be that (the agreement) between me and thee: whichever of the
 two terms I fulfil, let there be no ill-will to me.
 Be Allah a witness to what we say."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family,
 he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur.
 He said to his family: "Tarry ye; I perceive a fire; I hope to bring you
 from there some information, or a burning firebrand, that ye may warm yourselve

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when he came to the (fire), a voice was heard from the right bank of

\begin_layout Standard
"Now do thou throw thy rod!" but when he saw it moving (of its own accord)

\begin_layout Standard
"Move thy hand into thy bosom, and it will come forth white without stain

He said: "O my Lord! I have slain a man among them, and I fear lest they

Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs! no god do I know for you but myself: therefore,

Nor wast thou at the side of (the Mountain of) Tur when we called (to Moses).

If (We had) not (sent thee to the Quraish),- in case a calamity should seize

But (now), when the Truth has come to them from Ourselves, they say, "Why

 "Two kinds of sorcery, each assisting the other!" And they say: "For us,

Qarun was doubtless, of the people of Moses; but he acted insolently towards

 Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss you, but
 Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth.
 And when ye ask (his ladies) for anything ye want, ask them from before
 a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs.

Those who had been despised will say to the arrogant ones: "Nay! it was

The (people) said: "Ye are only men like ourselves; and (Allah) Most Gracious

 And a grievous punishment indeed will be inflicted on you by us."

They said: "Your evil omens are with yourselves: (deem ye this an evil omen).
 If ye are admonished? Nay, but ye are a people transgressing all bounds!"

Further, they say, "When will this promise (come to pass), if what ye say

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they have (other) profits from them (besides), and they get (milk) to
 drink.
 Will they not then be grateful?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet they take (for worship) gods other than Allah, (hoping) that they might
 be helped!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have not the power to help them: but they will be brought up (before
 Our Judgment-seat) as a troop (to be condemned).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let not their speech, then, grieve thee.
 Verily We know what they hide as well as what they disclose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Doth not man see that it is We Who created him from sperm? yet behold! he
 (stands forth) as an open adversary!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he makes comparisons for Us, and forgets his own (origin and) Creation:
 He says, "Who can give life to (dry) bones and decomposed ones (at that)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say, "He will give them life Who created them for the first time! for He
 is Well-versed in every kind of creation!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"The same Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold!
 ye kindle therewith (your own fires)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like
 thereof?" - Yea, indeed! for He is the Creator Supreme, of skill and knowledge
 (infinite)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, when He intends a thing, His Command is, "be", and it is!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So glory to Him in Whose hands is the dominion of all things: and to Him
 will ye be all brought back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By those who range themselves in ranks,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so are strong in repelling (evil),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thus proclaim the Message (of Allah)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, verily, your Allah is one!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all between them, and Lord of every
 point at the rising of the sun!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have indeed decked the lower heaven with beauty (in) the stars,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(For beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious evil spirits,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(So) they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly
 but be cast away from every side,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repulsed, for they are under a perpetual penalty,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except such as snatch away something by stealth, and they are pursued by
 a flaming fire, of piercing brightness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just ask their opinion: are they the more difficult to create, or the (other)
 beings We have created? Them have We created out of a sticky clay!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly dost thou marvel, while they ridicule,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, when they are admonished, pay no heed,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, when they see a Sign, turn it to mockery,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And say, "This is nothing but evident sorcery!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What! when we die, and become dust and bones, shall we (then) be raised
 up (again)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And also our fathers of old?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say thou: "Yea, and ye shall then be humiliated (on account of your evil)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it will be a single (compelling) cry; and behold, they will begin to
 see!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will say, "Ah! Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A voice will say,) "This is the Day of Sorting Out, whose truth ye (once)
 denied!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Bring ye up", it shall be said, "The wrong-doers and their wives, and the
 things they worshipped-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Besides Allah, and lead them to the Way to the (Fierce) Fire!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But stop them, for they must be asked:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'What is the matter with you that ye help not each other?'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, but that day they shall submit (to Judgment);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they will turn to one another, and question one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will say: "It was ye who used to come to us from the right hand (of
 power and authority)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will reply: "Nay, ye yourselves had no Faith!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nor had we any authority over you.
 Nay, it was ye who were a people in obstinate rebellion!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So now has been proved true, against us, the word of our Lord that we shall
 indeed (have to) taste (the punishment of our sins).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We led you astray: for truly we were ourselves astray."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly, that Day, they will (all) share in the Penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily that is how We shall deal with Sinners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For they, when they were told that there is no god except Allah, would puff
 themselves up with Pride,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And say: "What! shall we give up our gods for the sake of a Poet possessed?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay! he has come with the (very) Truth, and he confirms (the Message of)
 the messengers (before him).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ye shall indeed taste of the Grievous Penalty;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it will be no more than the retribution of (the Evil) that ye have wrought;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For them is a Sustenance determined,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fruits (Delights); and they (shall enjoy) honour and dignity,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Gardens of Felicity,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Facing each other on Thrones (of Dignity):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Round will be passed to them a Cup from a clear-flowing fountain,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crystal-white, of a taste delicious to those who drink (thereof),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Free from headiness; nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And besides them will be chaste women, restraining their glances, with big
 eyes (of wonder and beauty).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As if they were (delicate) eggs closely guarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they will turn to one another and question one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of them will start the talk and say: "I had an intimate companion (on
 the earth),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Who used to say, 'what! art thou amongst those who bear witness to the
 Truth (of the Message)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed receive rewards
 and punishments?'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A voice) said: "Would ye like to look down?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "By Allah! thou wast little short of bringing me to perdition!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I should certainly have been
 among those brought (there)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is it (the case) that we shall not die,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Except our first death, and that we shall not be punished?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily this is the supreme achievement!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the like of this let all strive, who wish to strive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is that the better entertainment or the Tree of Zaqqum?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For We have truly made it (as) a trial for the wrong-doers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-Fire:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of devils:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then on top of that they will be given a mixture made of boiling water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then shall their return be to the (Blazing) Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly they found their fathers on the wrong Path;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they (too) were rushed down on their footsteps!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And truly before them, many of the ancients went astray;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We sent aforetime, among them, (messengers) to admonish them;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then see what was the end of those who were admonished (but heeded not),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except the sincere (and devoted) Servants of Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(In the days of old), Noah cried to Us, and We are the best to hear prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We delivered him and his people from the Great Calamity,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made his progeny to endure (on this earth);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We left (this blessing) for him among generations to come in later times:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For he was one of our believing Servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold! he said to his father and to his people, "What is that which ye
 worship?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is it a falsehood- gods other than Allah- that ye desire?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Then what is your idea about the Lord of the worlds?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did he cast a glance at the Stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he said, "I am indeed sick (at heart)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they turned away from him, and departed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did he turn to their gods and said, "will ye not eat (of the offerings
 before you)?...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, and faced (him).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But Allah has created you and your handwork!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(This failing), they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them
 the ones most humiliated!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said:
 "O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what
 is thy view!" (The son) said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou
 will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid
 him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We called out to him "O Abraham!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward those
 who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this was obviously a trial-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later
 times:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Peace and salutation to Abraham!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For he was one of our believing Servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right,
 and (some) that obviously do wrong, to their own souls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We helped them, so they overcame (their troubles);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We guided them to the Straight Way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We left (this blessing) for them among generations (to come) in later
 times:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For they were two of our believing Servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, he said to his people, "Will ye not fear (Allah)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Allah, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers
 of old?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up (for punishment),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah (among them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later
 times:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Peace and salutation to such as Elias!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For he was one of our believing Servants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So also was Lut among those sent (by Us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We destroyed the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by night: will ye not understand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and
 they have sons?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it not that they say, from their own invention,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Allah has begotten children"? but they are liars!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the matter with you? How judge ye?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will ye not then receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or have ye an authority manifest?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but
 the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his
 Judgment-Seat)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glory to Allah! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not (so do) the Servants of Allah, sincere and devoted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing Fire!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Those ranged in ranks say): "Not one of us but has a place appointed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And we are verily ranged in ranks (for service);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And we are verily those who declare (Allah's) glory!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there were those who said,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If only we had had before us a Message from those of old,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We should certainly have been Servants of Allah, sincere (and devoted)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But (now that the Qur'an has come), they reject it: But soon will they know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by
 Us),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That they would certainly be assisted,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So turn thou away from them for a little while,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And watch them (how they fare), and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do they wish (indeed) to hurry on our Punishment?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be the morning
 for those who were warned (and heeded not)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So turn thou away from them for a little while,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And watch (how they fare) and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what
 they ascribe (to Him)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Peace on the messengers!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Praise to Allah, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sad: By the Qur'an, Full of Admonition: (This is the Truth).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Unbelievers (are steeped) in self-glory and Separatism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many generations before them did We destroy? In the end they cried (for
 mercy)- when there was no longer time for being saved!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So they wonder that a Warner has come to them from among themselves! and
 the Unbelievers say, "This is a sorcerer telling lies!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Has he made the gods (all) into one Allah? Truly this is a wonderful thing!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the leader among them go away (impatiently), (saying), "Walk ye away,
 and remain constant to your gods! For this is truly a thing designed (against
 you)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We never heard (the like) of this among the people of these latter days:
 this is nothing but a made-up tale!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What! has the Message been sent to him - (Of all persons) among us?"...
 but they are in doubt concerning My (Own) Message! Nay, they have not yet
 tasted My Punishment!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or have they the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord,- the Exalted in Power,
 the Grantor of Bounties without measure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or have they the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all between?
 If so, let them mount up with the ropes and means (to reach that end)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before them (were many who) rejected messengers,- the people of Noah, and
 'Ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Thamud, and the people of Lut, and the Companions of the Wood; - such
 were the Confederates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not one (of them) but rejected the messengers, but My punishment came justly
 and inevitably (on them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These (today) only wait for a single mighty Blast, which (when it comes)
 will brook no delay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They say: "Our Lord! hasten to us our sentence (even) before the Day of
 Account!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have patience at what they say, and remember our servant David, the man
 of strength: for he ever turned (to Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was We that made the hills declare, in unison with him, Our Praises,
 at eventide and at break of day,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the birds gathered (in assemblies): all with him did turn (to Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We strengthened his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech
 and decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has the Story of the Disputants reached thee? Behold, they climbed over
 the wall of the private chamber;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they entered the presence of David, and he was terrified of them, they
 said: "Fear not: we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other:
 Decide now between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, but
 guide us to the even Path..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This man is my brother: He has nine and ninety ewes, and I have (but) one:
 Yet he says, 'commit her to my care,' and is (moreover) harsh to me in
 speech."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(David) said: "He has undoubtedly wronged thee in demanding thy (single)
 ewe to be added to his (flock of) ewes: truly many are the partners (in
 business) who wrong each other: Not so do those who believe and work deeds

 and David gathered that We had tried him: he asked forgiveness of his Lord,
 fell down, bowing (in prostration), and turned (to Allah in repentance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We forgave him this (lapse): he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us,
 and a beautiful place of (Final) Return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O David! We did indeed make thee a vicegerent on earth: so judge thou between
 men in truth (and justice): Nor follow thou the lusts (of thy heart), for
 they will mislead thee from the Path of Allah: for those who wander astray
 from the Path of Allah, is a Penalty Grievous, for that they forget the
 Day of Account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not without purpose did We create heaven and earth and all between! that

Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the same

 evil, the same as those who turn aside from the right?

(Here is) a Book which We have sent down unto thee, full of blessings, that
 they may mediate on its Signs, and that men of understanding may receive
 admonition.

\begin_layout Standard
To David We gave Solomon (for a son),- How excellent in Our service! Ever
 did he turn (to Us)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, there were brought before him, at eventide coursers of the highest
 breeding, and swift of foot;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he said, "Truly do I love the love of good, with a view to the glory
 of my Lord,"- until (the sun) was hidden in the veil (of night):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Bring them back to me." then began he to pass his hand over (their) legs
 and their necks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We did try Solomon: We placed on his throne a body (without life); but
 he did turn (to Us in true devotion):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said, "O my Lord! Forgive me, and grant me a kingdom which, (it may be),
 suits not another after me: for Thou art the Grantor of Bounties (without
 measure).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We subjected the wind to his power, to flow gently to his order, Whithersoe
ver he willed,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As also the evil ones, (including) every kind of builder and diver,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As also others bound together in fetters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Such are Our Bounties: whether thou bestow them (on others) or withhold
 them, no account will be asked."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he enjoyed, indeed, a Near Approach to Us, and a beautiful Place of
 (Final) Return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commemorate Our Servant Job.
 Behold he cried to his Lord: "The Evil One has afflicted me with distress
 and suffering!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The command was given:) "Strike with thy foot: here is (water) wherein
 to wash, cool and refreshing, and (water) to drink."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We gave him (back) his people, and doubled their number,- as a Grace
 from Ourselves, and a thing for commemoration, for all who have Understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And take in thy hand a little grass, and strike therewith: and break not
 (thy oath)." Truly We found him full of patience and constancy.
 How excellent in Our service! ever did he turn (to Us)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And commemorate Our Servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, possessors of Power
 and Vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily We did choose them for a special (purpose)- proclaiming the Message
 of the Hereafter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They were, in Our sight, truly, of the company of the Elect and the Good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And commemorate Isma'il, Elisha, and Zul-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company
 of the Good.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a Message (of admonition): and verily, for the righteous, is a beautiful

\begin_layout Standard
Gardens of Eternity, whose doors will (ever) be open to them;

\begin_layout Standard
Therein will they recline (at ease): Therein can they call (at pleasure)
 for fruit in abundance, and (delicious) drink;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And beside them will be chaste women restraining their glances, (companions)
 of equal age.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such is the Promise made, to you for the Day of Account!

\begin_layout Standard
Truly such will be Our Bounty (to you); it will never fail;-

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, such! but - for the wrong-doers will be an evil place of (Final) Return!-

\begin_layout Standard
Hell!- they will burn therein, - an evil bed (indeed, to lie on)!-

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, such! - then shall they taste it,- a boiling fluid, and a fluid dark,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And other Penalties of a similar kind, to match them!

Here is a troop rushing headlong with you! No welcome for them! truly, they

\begin_layout Standard
They will say: "Our Lord! whoever brought this upon us,- Add to him a double
 Penalty in the Fire!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they will say: "What has happened to us that we see not men whom we
 used to number among the bad ones?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Did we treat them (as such) in ridicule, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive
 them?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly that is just and fitting,- the mutual recriminations of the People
 of the Fire!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "Truly am I a Warner: no god is there but the one Allah, Supreme and
 Irresistible,-

"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between,- Exalted in Might,

\begin_layout Standard
Not so Iblis: he was haughty, and became one of those who reject Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Allah) said: "O Iblis! What prevents thee from prostrating thyself to one
 whom I have created with my hands? Art thou haughty? Or art thou one of
 the high (and mighty) ones?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Iblis) said: "I am better than he: thou createdst me from fire, and him
 thou createdst from clay."

(Allah) said: "Then get thee out from here: for thou art rejected, accursed.

The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Power, full of

\begin_layout Standard
Verily it is We Who have revealed the Book to thee in Truth: so serve Allah,
 offering Him sincere devotion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due? But those who take for
 protectors other than Allah (say): "We only serve them in order that they
 may bring us nearer to Allah." Truly Allah will judge between them in that
 wherein they differ.
 But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had Allah wished to take to Himself a son, He could have chosen whom He
 pleased out of those whom He doth create: but Glory be to Him! (He is above
 such things.) He is Allah, the One, the Irresistible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He created the heavens and the earth in true (proportions): He makes the
 Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night: He has subjected
 the sun and the moon (to His law): Each one follows a course for a time
 appointed.
 Is not He the Exalted in Power - He Who forgives again and again?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He created you (all) from a single person: then created, of like nature,
 his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes
 you, in the wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three
 veils of darkness.
 such is Allah, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion.
 There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Centre)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If ye reject (Allah), Truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh not
 ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you.
 No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another.
 In the end, to your Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth
 of all that ye did (in this life).
 for He knoweth well all that is in (men's) hearts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When some trouble toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning to Him
 in repentance: but when He bestoweth a favour upon him as from Himself,
 (man) doth forget what he cried and prayed for before, and he doth set
 up rivals unto Allah, thus misleading others from Allah's Path.
 Say, "Enjoy thy blasphemy for a little while: verily thou art (one) of
 the Companions of the Fire!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself

 those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who
 are endued with understanding that receive admonition.

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "O ye my servants who believe! Fear your Lord, good is (the reward)

Those who eschew Evil,- and fall not into its worship,- and turn to Allah

\begin_layout Standard
Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best (meaning) in it: those

 understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is, then, one against whom the decree of Punishment is justly due (equal
 to one who eschews Evil)? Wouldst thou, then, deliver one (who is) in the
 Fire?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is for those who fear their Lord.
 That lofty mansions, one above another, have been built: beneath them flow
 rivers (of delight): (such is) the Promise of Allah: never doth Allah fail
 in (His) promise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through
 springs in the earth? Then He causes to grow, therewith, produce of various
 colours: then it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow; then He makes it
 dry up and crumble away.
 Truly, in this, is a Message of remembrance to men of understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is one whose heart Allah has opened to Islam, so that he has received Enlightenm
ent from Allah, (no better than one hard-hearted)? Woe to those whose hearts
 are hardened against celebrating the praises of Allah! they are manifestly
 wandering (in error)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful Message in the
 form of a Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in
 various aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat;
 then their skins and their hearts do soften to the celebration of Allah's
 praises.
 Such is the guidance of Allah: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but
 such as Allah leaves to stray, can have none to guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is, then, one who has to fear the brunt of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment
 (and receive it) on his face, (like one guarded therefrom)? It will be
 said to the wrong-doers: "Taste ye (the fruits of) what ye earned!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those before them (also) rejected (revelation), and so the Punishment came
 to them from directions they did not perceive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Allah gave them a taste of humiliation in the present life, but greater
 is the punishment of the Hereafter, if they only knew!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have put forth for men, in this Qur'an every kind of Parable, in order
 that they may receive admonition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) a Qur'an in Arabic, without any crookedness (therein): in order
 that they may guard against Evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah puts forth a Parable a man belonging to many partners at variance
 with each other, and a man belonging entirely to one master: are those
 two equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! but most of them have no knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly thou wilt die (one day), and truly they (too) will die (one day).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end will ye (all), on the Day of Judgment, settle your disputes in
 the presence of your Lord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who, then, doth more wrong than one who utters a lie concerning Allah, and
 rejects the Truth when it comes to him; is there not in Hell an abode for
 blasphemers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he who brings the Truth and he who confirms (and supports) it - such
 are the men who do right.

\begin_layout Standard
They shall have all that they wish for, in the presence of their Lord: such
 is the reward of those who do good:

So that Allah will turn off from them (even) the worst in their deeds and
 give them their reward according to the best of what they have done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is not Allah enough for his Servant? But they try to frighten thee with
 other (gods) besides Him! for such as Allah leaves to stray, there can
 be no guide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And such as Allah doth guide there can be none to lead astray.
 Is not Allah Exalted in Power, (Able to enforce His Will), Lord of Retribution?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth,
 they would be sure to say, "Allah".
 Say: "See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides Allah,- can they,
 if Allah wills some Penalty for me, remove His Penalty?- Or if He wills
 some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?" Say: "Sufficient is Allah
 for me! In Him trust those who put their trust."
\end_layout

Verily We have revealed the Book to thee in Truth, for (instructing) mankind.
 He, then, that receives guidance benefits his own soul: but he that strays
 injures his own soul.
 Nor art thou set over them to dispose of their affairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is Allah that takes the souls (of men) at death; and those that die not
 (He takes) during their sleep: those on whom He has passed the decree of
 death, He keeps back (from returning to life), but the rest He sends (to
 their bodies) for a term appointed verily in this are Signs for those who
 reflect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What! Do they take for intercessors others besides Allah? Say: "Even if
 they have no power whatever and no intelligence?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: In the End, it is
 to Him that ye shall be brought back."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Allah, the One and Only, is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe

 other than He are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of all that

\begin_layout Standard
Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more,
 (in vain) would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the Penalty on
 the Day of Judgment: but something will confront them from Allah, which
 they could never have counted upon!
\end_layout

For the evils of their Deeds will confront them, and they will be (completely)
 encircled by that which they used to mock at!

\begin_layout Standard
Now, when trouble touches man, he cries to Us: But when We bestow a favour

 of a certain knowledge (I have)!" Nay, but this is but a trial, but most
 of them understand not!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus did the (generations) before them say! But all that they did was of
 no profit to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, the evil results of their Deeds overtook them.
 And the wrong-doers of this (generation)- the evil results of their Deeds
 will soon overtake them (too), and they will never be able to frustrate
 (Our Plan)!

Know they not that Allah enlarges the provision or restricts it, for any

Nay, but worship Allah, and be of those who give thanks.

No just estimate have they made of Allah, such as is due to Him: On the

Behold, the messengers came to them, from before them and behind them, (preachin

Now the 'Ad behaved arrogantly through the land, against (all) truth and

But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to

But indeed if any show patience and forgive, that would truly be an exercise

Such are the Signs of Allah, which We rehearse to thee in Truth; then in

Woe to each sinful dealer in Falsehoods:

\begin_layout Standard
He hears the Signs of Allah rehearsed to him, yet is obstinate and lofty,

And when he learns something of Our Signs, he takes them in jest: for such

In front of them is Hell: and of no profit to them is anything they may

 Allah: for them is a tremendous Penalty.

This is (true) Guidance and for those who reject the Signs of their Lord,

It is Allah Who has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through

We did aforetime grant to the Children of Israel the Book the Power of Command,

 We favoured them above the nations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We granted them Clear Signs in affairs (of Religion): it was only after
 knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into schisms, through
 insolent envy among themselves.
 Verily thy Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment as to those
 matters in which they set up differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We put thee on the (right) Way of Religion: so follow thou that (Way),

\begin_layout Standard
These are clear evidences to men and a Guidance and Mercy to those of assured

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What! Do those who seek after evil ways think that We shall hold them equal
 with those who believe and do righteous deeds,- that equal will be their
 life and their death? Ill is the judgment that they make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah created the heavens and the earth for just ends, and in order that
 each soul may find the recompense of what it has earned, and none of them
 be wronged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then seest thou such a one as takes as his god his own vain desire? Allah
 has, knowing (him as such), left him astray, and sealed his hearing and
 his heart (and understanding), and put a cover on his sight.
 Who, then, will guide him after Allah (has withdrawn Guidance)? Will ye
 not then receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they say: "What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and
 we live, and nothing but time can destroy us." But of that they have no
 knowledge: they merely conjecture:

And when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them their argument is nothing
 but this: They say, "Bring (back) our forefathers, if what ye say is true!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "It is Allah Who gives you life, then gives you death; then He will
 gather you together for the Day of Judgment about which there is no doubt":
 But most men do not understand.

To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and the Day

 Falsehood perish!

"This Our Record speaks about you with truth: For We were wont to put on
 Record all that ye did."

\begin_layout Standard
Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will
 admit them to His Mercy that will be the achievement for all to see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as to those who rejected Allah, (to them will be said): "Were not Our
 Signs rehearsed to you? But ye were arrogant, and were a people given to
 sin!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And when it was said that the promise of Allah was true, and that the Hour-
 there was no doubt about its (coming), ye used to say, 'We know not what
 is the hour: we only think it is an idea, and we have no firm assurance.'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then will appear to them the evil (fruits) of what they did, and they will
 be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will also be said: "This Day We will forget you as ye forgot the meeting
 of this Day of yours! and your abode is the Fire, and no helpers have ye!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This, because ye used to take the Signs of Allah in jest, and the life
 of the world deceived you:" (From) that Day, therefore, they shall not
 be taken out thence, nor shall they be received into Grace.

\begin_layout Standard
Then Praise be to Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth,- Lord

We created not the heavens and the earth and all between them but for just
 ends, and for a Term Appointed: But those who reject Faith turn away from
 that whereof they are warned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "Do ye see what it is ye invoke besides Allah? Show me what it is they
 have created on earth, or have they a share in the heavens bring me a book
 (revealed) before this, or any remnant of knowledge (ye may have), if ye
 are telling the truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allah, such as will
 not answer him to the Day of Judgment, and who (in fact) are unconscious
 of their call (to them)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when mankind are gathered together (at the Resurrection), they will
 be hostile to them and reject their worship (altogether)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Our Clear Signs are rehearsed to them, the Unbelievers say, of the
 Truth when it comes to them: "This is evident sorcery!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or do they say, "He has forged it"? Say: "Had I forged it, then can ye obtain
 no single (blessing) for me from Allah.
 He knows best of that whereof ye talk (so glibly)! Enough is He for a witness
 between me and you! And he is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "I am no bringer of new-fangled doctrine among the messengers, nor
 do I know what will be done with me or with you.
 I follow but that which is revealed to me by inspiration; I am but a Warner
 open and clear."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "See ye? If (this teaching) be from Allah, and ye reject it, and a
 witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity (with
 earlier scripture), and has believed while ye are arrogant, (how unjust
 ye are!) truly, Allah guides not a people unjust."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Unbelievers say of those who believe: "If (this Message) were a good
 thing, (such men) would not have gone to it first, before us!" And seeing
 that they guide not themselves thereby, they will say, "this is an (old,)
 falsehood!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And before this, was the Book of Moses as a guide and a mercy: And this
 Book confirms (it) in the Arabic tongue; to admonish the unjust, and as
 Glad Tidings to those who do right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily those who say, "Our Lord is Allah," and remain firm (on that Path),-
 on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such shall be Companions of the Gardens, dwelling therein (for aye): a recompens

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents: In pain did his mother
 bear him, and in pain did she give him birth.
 The carrying of the (child) to his weaning is (a period of) thirty months.
 At length, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years,
 he says, "O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which
 Thou has bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and that I may work
 righteousness such as Thou mayest approve; and be gracious to me in my
 issue.
 Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow (to Thee) in Islam."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such are they from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and pass
 by their ill deeds: (They shall be) among the Companions of the Garden:
 a promise! of truth, which was made to them (in this life).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But (there is one) who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do ye hold out
 the promise to me that I shall be raised up, even though generations have
 passed before me (without rising again)?" And they two seek Allah's aid,
 (and rebuke the son): "Woe to thee! Have faith! for the promise of Allah
 is true." But he says, "This is nothing but tales of the ancients!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such are they against whom is proved the sentence among the previous generations
 of Jinns and men, that have passed away; for they will be (utterly) lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to all are (assigned) degrees according to the deeds which they (have
 done), and in order that (Allah) may recompense their deeds, and no injustice
 be done to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (It
 will be said to them): "Ye received your good things in the life of the
 world, and ye took your pleasure out of them: but today shall ye be recompensed
 with a Penalty of humiliation: for that ye were arrogant on earth without
 just cause, and that ye (ever) transgressed."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mention (Hud) one of 'Ad's (own) brethren: Behold, he warned his people
 about the winding Sand-tracts: but there have been warners before him and
 after him: "Worship ye none other than Allah: Truly I fear for you the
 Penalty of a Mighty Day."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said: "Hast thou come in order to turn us aside from our gods? Then
 bring upon us the (calamity) with which thou dost threaten us, if thou
 art telling the truth?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "The Knowledge (of when it will come) is only with Allah: I proclaim
 to you the mission on which I have been sent: But I see that ye are a people
 in ignorance!"..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when they saw the (Penalty in the shape of) a cloud traversing the
 sky, coming to meet their valleys, they said, "This cloud will give us
 rain!" "Nay, it is the (Calamity) ye were asking to be hastened!- A wind
 wherein is a Grievous Penalty!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Everything will it destroy by the command of its Lord!" Then by the morning
 they - nothing was to be seen but (the ruins of) their houses! thus do
 We recompense those given to sin!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We had firmly established them in a (prosperity and) power which We
 have not given to you (ye Quraish!) and We had endowed them with (faculties
 of) hearing, seeing, heart and intellect: but of no profit to them were
 their (faculties of) hearing, sight, and heart and intellect, when they
 went on rejecting the Signs of Allah; and they were (completely) encircled
 by that which they used to mock at!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We destroyed aforetime populations round about you; and We have shown the
 Signs in various ways, that they may turn (to Us).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why then was no help forthcoming to them from those whom they worshipped
 as gods, besides Allah, as a means of access (to Allah)? Nay, they left
 them in the lurch: but that was their falsehood and their invention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, We turned towards thee a company of Jinns (quietly) listening to
 the Qur'an: when they stood in the presence thereof, they said, "Listen
 in silence!" When the (reading) was finished, they returned to their people,
 to warn (them of their sins).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "O our people! We have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming
 what came before it: it guides (men) to the Truth and to a Straight Path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"O our people, hearken to the one who invites (you) to Allah, and believe
 in him: He will forgive you your faults, and deliver you from a Penalty
 Grievous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If any does not hearken to the one who invites (us) to Allah, he cannot
 frustrate (Allah's Plan) on earth, and no protectors can he have besides
 Allah: such men (wander) in manifest error."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, and never
 wearied with their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yea, verily
 He has power over all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on the Day that the Unbelievers will be placed before the Fire, (they
 will be asked,) "Is this not the Truth?" they will say, "Yea, by our Lord!"
 (One will say:) "Then taste ye the Penalty, for that ye were wont to deny
 (Truth)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore patiently persevere, as did (all) messengers of inflexible purpose;
 and be in no haste about the (Unbelievers).
 On the Day that they see the (Punishment) promised them, (it will be) as
 if they had not tarried more than an hour in a single day.
 (Thine but) to proclaim the Message: but shall any be destroyed except
 those who transgress?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who reject Allah and hinder (men) from the Path of Allah,- their deeds
 will Allah render astray (from their mark).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, and believe in the
 (Revelation) sent down to Muhammad - for it is the Truth from their Lord,-
 He will remove from them their ills and improve their condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This because those who reject Allah follow vanities, while those who believe
 follow the Truth from their Lord: Thus does Allah set forth for men their
 lessons by similitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks;
 At length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on
 them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until
 the war lays down its burdens.
 Thus (are ye commanded): but if it had been Allah's Will, He could certainly
 have exacted retribution from them (Himself); but (He lets you fight) in
 order to test you, some with others.
 But those who are slain in the Way of Allah,- He will never let their deeds
 be lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will He guide them and improve their condition,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And admit them to the Garden which He has announced for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O ye who believe! If ye will aid (the cause of) Allah, He will aid you,
 and plant your feet firmly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those who reject (Allah),- for them is destruction, and (Allah) will
 render their deeds astray (from their mark).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is because they hate the Revelation of Allah; so He has made their
 deeds fruitless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the End of those
 before them (who did evil)? Allah brought utter destruction on them, and
 similar (fates await) those who reject Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, but those who

Has the story reached thee, of the honoured guests of Abraham?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, they entered his presence, and said: "Peace!" He said, "Peace!"
 (and thought, "These seem) unusual people."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And placed it before them..
 he said, "Will ye not eat?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(When they did not eat), He conceived a fear of them.
 They said, "Fear not," and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed
 with knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But his wife came forward (laughing) aloud: she smote her forehead and said:
 "A barren old woman!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "Even so has thy Lord spoken: and He is full of Wisdom and Knowledge."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Abraham) said: "And what, O ye Messengers, is your errand (now)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They said, "We have been sent to a people (deep) in sin;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"To bring on, on them, (a shower of) stones of clay (brimstone),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Marked as from thy Lord for those who trespass beyond bounds."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then We evacuated those of the Believers who were there,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We found not there any just (Muslim) persons except in one house:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We left there a Sign for such as fear the Grievous Penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in Moses (was another Sign): Behold, We sent him to Pharaoh, with authority
 manifest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But (Pharaoh) turned back with his Chiefs, and said, "A sorcerer, or one
 possessed!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We took him and his forces, and threw them into the sea; and his was
 the blame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in the 'Ad (people) (was another Sign): Behold, We sent against them
 the devastating Wind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It left nothing whatever that it came up against, but reduced it to ruin
 and rottenness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in the Thamud (was another Sign): Behold, they were told, "Enjoy (your
 brief day) for a little while!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord: So the stunning noise
 (of an earthquake) seized them, even while they were looking on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they could not even stand (on their feet), nor could they help themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So were the People of Noah before them for they wickedly transgressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: for it is We Who create
 the vastness of pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread
 out!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of every thing We have created pairs: That ye may receive instruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hasten ye then (at once) to Allah: I am from Him a Warner to you, clear
 and open!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And make not another an object of worship with Allah: I am from Him a Warner
 to you, clear and open!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, no messenger came to the Peoples before them, but they said (of
 him) in like manner, "A sorcerer, or one possessed"!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this the legacy they have transmitted, one to another? Nay, they are
 themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So turn away from them: not thine is the blame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But teach (thy Message) for teaching benefits the Believers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have only created Jinns and men, that they may serve Me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No Sustenance do I require of them, nor do I require that they should feed
 Me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Allah is He Who gives (all) Sustenance,- Lord of Power,- Steadfast (for
 ever).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Wrong-doers, their portion is like unto the portion of their fellows
 (of earlier generations): then let them not ask Me to hasten (that portion)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe, then, to the Unbelievers, on account of that Day of theirs which they
 have been promised!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Mount (of Revelation);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By a Decree inscribed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a Scroll unfolded;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the much-frequented Fane;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Canopy Raised High;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Ocean filled with Swell;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is none can avert it;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains will fly hither and thither.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then woe that Day to those that treat (Truth) as Falsehood;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That play (and paddle) in shallow trifles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell, irresistibly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This:, it will be said, "Is the Fire,- which ye were wont to deny!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is this then a fake, or is it ye that do not see?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Burn ye therein: the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience,
 or not: Ye but receive the recompense of your (own) deeds."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the Righteous, they will be in Gardens, and in Happiness,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enjoying the (Bliss) which their Lord hath bestowed on them, and their Lord
 shall deliver them from the Penalty of the Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(To them will be said:) "Eat and drink ye, with profit and health, because
 of your (good) deeds."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will recline (with ease) on Thrones (of dignity) arranged in ranks;
 and We shall join them to Companions, with beautiful big and lustrous eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who believe and whose families follow them in Faith,- to them
 shall We join their families: Nor shall We deprive them (of the fruit)
 of aught of their works: (Yet) is each individual in pledge for his deeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We shall bestow on them, of fruit and meat, anything they shall desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They shall there exchange, one with another, a (loving) cup free of frivolity,
 free of all taint of ill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Round about them will serve, (devoted) to them, young male servants (handsome)
 as Pearls well-guarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will advance to each other, engaging in mutual enquiry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will say: "Aforetime, we were not without fear for the sake of our
 people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But Allah has been good to us, and has delivered us from the Penalty of
 the Scorching Wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Truly, we did call unto Him from of old: truly it is He, the Beneficent,
 the Merciful!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore proclaim thou the praises (of thy Lord): for by the Grace of thy
 Lord, thou art no (vulgar) soothsayer, nor art thou one possessed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or do they say:- "A Poet! we await for him some calamity (hatched) by Time!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say thou: "Await ye!- I too will wait along with you!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it that their faculties of understanding urge them to this, or are they
 but a people transgressing beyond bounds?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or do they say, "He fabricated the (Message)"? Nay, they have no faith!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let them then produce a recital like unto it,- If (it be) they speak the
 truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were they created of nothing, or were they themselves the creators?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no firm belief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or are the Treasures of thy Lord with them, or are they the managers (of
 affairs)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or have they a ladder, by which they can (climb up to heaven and) listen
 (to its secrets)? Then let (such a) listener of theirs produce a manifest
 proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or has He only daughters and ye have sons?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or is it that thou dost ask for a reward, so that they are burdened with
 a load of debt?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or that the Unseen in it their hands, and they write it down?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or do they intend a plot (against thee)? But those who defy Allah are themselves
 involved in a Plot!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or have they a god other than Allah? Exalted is Allah far above the things
 they associate with Him!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were they to see a piece of the sky falling (on them), they would (only)
 say: "Clouds gathered in heaps!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So leave them alone until they encounter that Day of theirs, wherein they
 shall (perforce) swoon (with terror),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day when their plotting will avail them nothing and no help shall be
 given them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment besides
 this: But most of them understand not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now await in patience the command of thy Lord: for verily thou art in Our
 eyes: and celebrate the praises of thy Lord the while thou standest forth,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And for part of the night also praise thou Him,- and at the retreat of the
 stars!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Star when it goes down,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your Companion is neither astray nor being misled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is no less than inspiration sent down to him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was taught by one Mighty in Power,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Endued with Wisdom: for he appeared (in stately form);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While he was in the highest part of the horizon:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he approached and came closer,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And was at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So did (Allah) convey the inspiration to His Servant- (conveyed) what He
 (meant) to convey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart in no way falsified that which he saw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he saw?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For indeed he saw him at a second descent,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Near the Lote-tree beyond which none may pass:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Near it is the Garden of Abode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, the Lote-tree was shrouded (in mystery unspeakable!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(His) sight never swerved, nor did it go wrong!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For truly did he see, of the Signs of his Lord, the Greatest!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have ye seen Lat.
 and 'Uzza,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And another, the third (goddess), Manat?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What! for you the male sex, and for Him, the female?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, such would be indeed a division most unfair!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are nothing but names which ye have devised,- ye and your fathers,-
 for which Allah has sent down no authority (whatever).
 They follow nothing but conjecture and what their own souls desire!- Even
 though there has already come to them Guidance from their Lord!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, shall man have (just) anything he hankers after?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is to Allah that the End and the Beginning (of all things) belong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How many-so-ever be the angels in the heavens, their intercession will avail
 nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He pleases and that
 he is acceptable to Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who believe not in the Hereafter, name the angels with female names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they have no knowledge therein.
 They follow nothing but conjecture; and conjecture avails nothing against
 Truth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore shun those who turn away from Our Message and desire nothing but
 the life of this world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is as far as knowledge will reach them.
 Verily thy Lord knoweth best those who stray from His Path, and He knoweth
 best those who receive guidance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth: so that He
 rewards those who do evil, according to their deeds, and He rewards those
 who do good, with what is best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, only (falling into) small
 faults,- verily thy Lord is ample in forgiveness.
 He knows you well when He brings you out of the earth, And when ye are
 hidden in your mothers' wombs.
 Therefore justify not yourselves: He knows best who it is that guards against
 evil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou one who turns back,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gives a little, then hardens (his heart)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What! Has he knowledge of the Unseen so that he can see?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, is he not acquainted with what is in the Books of Moses-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of Abraham who fulfilled his engagements?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Namely, that no bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That man can have nothing but what he strives for;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That (the fruit of) his striving will soon come in sight:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then will he be rewarded with a reward complete;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That to thy Lord is the final Goal;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That it is He Who granteth Laughter and Tears;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That it is He Who granteth Death and Life;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That He did create in pairs,- male and female,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a seed when lodged (in its place);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That He hath promised a Second Creation (Raising of the Dead);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That it is He Who giveth wealth and satisfaction;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that it is He Who destroyed the (powerful) ancient 'Ad (people),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Thamud nor gave them a lease of perpetual life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And before them, the people of Noah, for that they were (all) most unjust
 and most insolent transgressors,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that (ruins unknown) have covered them up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the gifts of thy Lord, (O man,) wilt thou dispute about?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a Warner, of the (series of) Warners of old!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (Judgment) ever approaching draws nigh:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No (soul) but Allah can lay it bare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do ye then wonder at this recital?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And will ye laugh and not weep,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wasting your time in vanities?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But fall ye down in prostration to Allah, and adore (Him)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hour (of Judgment) is nigh, and the moon is cleft asunder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, "This is (but) transient
 magic."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They reject (the warning) and follow their (own) lusts but every matter
 has its appointed time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have already come to them Recitals wherein there is (enough) to check
 (them),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mature wisdom;- but (the preaching of) Warners profits them not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, (O Prophet,) turn away from them.
 The Day that the Caller will call (them) to a terrible affair,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will come forth,- their eyes humbled - from (their) graves, (torpid)
 like locusts scattered abroad,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hastening, with eyes transfixed, towards the Caller!- "Hard is this Day!",
 the Unbelievers will say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before them the People of Noah rejected (their messenger): they rejected
 Our servant, and said, "Here is one possessed!", and he was driven out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he called on his Lord: "I am one overcome: do Thou then help (me)!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met (and
 rose) to the extent decreed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We bore him on an (Ark) made of broad planks and caulked with palm-fibre:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She floats under our eyes (and care): a recompense to one who had been rejected
 (with scorn)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have left this as a Sign (for all time): then is there any that will
 receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then
 is there any that will receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'Ad (people) (too) rejected (Truth): then how terrible was My Penalty
 and My Warning?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For We sent against them a furious wind, on a Day of violent Disaster,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plucking out men as if they were roots of palm-trees torn up (from the ground).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then
 is there any that will receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Thamud (also) rejected (their) Warners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For they said: "What! a man! a Solitary one from among ourselves! shall
 we follow such a one? Truly should we then be straying in mind, and mad!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Is it that the Message is sent to him, of all people amongst us? Nay, he
 is a liar, an insolent one!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah! they will know on the morrow, which is the liar, the insolent one!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For We will send the she-camel by way of trial for them.
 So watch them, (O Salih), and possess thyself in patience!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And tell them that the water is to be divided between them: Each one's right
 to drink being brought forward (by suitable turns).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they called to their companion, and he took a sword in hand, and hamstrung
 (her).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah! how (terrible) was My Penalty and My Warning!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For We sent against them a single Mighty Blast, and they became like the
 dry stubble used by one who pens cattle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then
 is there any that will receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The people of Lut rejected (his) warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sent against them a violent Tornado with showers of stones, (which destroyed
 them), except Lut's household: them We delivered by early Dawn,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a Grace from Us: thus do We reward those who give thanks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (Lut) did warn them of Our Punishment, but they disputed about the Warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they even sought to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded
 their eyes.
 (They heard:) "Now taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early on the morrow an abiding Punishment seized them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then
 is there any that will receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the People of Pharaoh, too, aforetime, came Warners (from Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (people) rejected all Our Signs; but We seized them with such Penalty
 (as comes) from One Exalted in Power, able to carry out His Will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are your Unbelievers, (O Quraish), better than they? Or have ye an immunity
 in the Sacred Books?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or do they say: "We acting together can defend ourselves"?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will their multitude be put to flight, and they will show their backs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, the Hour (of Judgment) is the time promised them (for their full recompense
): And that Hour will be most grievous and most bitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly those in sin are the ones straying in mind, and mad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day they will be dragged through the Fire on their faces, (they will
 hear:) "Taste ye the touch of Hell!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, all things have We created in proportion and measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Our Command is but a single (Act),- like the twinkling of an eye.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (oft) in the past, have We destroyed gangs like unto you: then is there
 any that will receive admonition?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All that they do is noted in (their) Books (of Deeds):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every matter, small and great, is on record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the Righteous, they will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an Assembly of Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Allah) Most Gracious!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is He Who has taught the Qur'an.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He has created man:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He has taught him speech (and intelligence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sun and the moon follow courses (exactly) computed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the herbs and the trees - both (alike) prostrate in adoration.

\begin_layout Standard
And the Firmament has He raised high, and He has set up the Balance (of
 Justice),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order that ye may not transgress (due) balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So establish weight with justice and fall not short in the balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is He Who has spread out the earth for (His) creatures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein is fruit and date-palms, producing spathes (enclosing dates);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also corn, with (its) leaves and stalk for fodder, and sweet-smelling plants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He created man from sounding clay like unto pottery,

\begin_layout Standard
And He created Jinns from fire free of smoke:

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
(He is) Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests:

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He has let free the two bodies of flowing water, meeting together:

\begin_layout Standard
Between them is a Barrier which they do not transgress:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
Out of them come Pearls and Coral:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

And His are the Ships sailing smoothly through the seas, lofty as mountains:

All that is on earth will perish:

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
Of Him seeks (its need) every creature in the heavens and on earth: every

Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
Soon shall We settle your affairs, O both ye worlds!

Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
O ye assembly of Jinns and men! If it be ye can pass beyond the zones of
 the heavens and the earth, pass ye! not without authority shall ye be able
 to pass!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
On you will be sent (O ye evil ones twain!) a flame of fire (to burn) and

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
When the sky is rent asunder, and it becomes red like ointment:

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
On that Day no question will be asked of man or Jinn as to his sin.

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
(For) the sinners will be known by their marks: and they will be seized

\begin_layout Standard
This is the Hell which the Sinners deny:

In its midst and in the midst of boiling hot water will they wander round!

But for such as fear the time when they will stand before (the Judgment

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-

Containing all kinds (of trees and delights);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In them (each) will be two Springs flowing (free);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In them will be Fruits of every kind, two and two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will recline on Carpets, whose inner linings will be of rich brocade:
 the Fruit of the Gardens will be near (and easy of reach).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In them will be (Maidens), chaste, restraining their glances, whom no man
 or Jinn before them has touched;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like unto Rubies and coral.

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
Is there any Reward for Good - other than Good?

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
And besides these two, there are two other Gardens,-

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dark-green in colour (from plentiful watering).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In them (each) will be two Springs pouring forth water in continuous abundance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
In them will be Fruits, and dates and pomegranates:

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?

\begin_layout Standard
In them will be fair (Companions), good, beautiful;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Companions restrained (as to their glances), in (goodly) pavilions;-

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whom no man or Jinn before them has touched;-

\begin_layout Standard
Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?-

\begin_layout Standard
Reclining on green Cushions and rich Carpets of beauty.

\begin_layout Standard
Blessed be the name of thy Lord, full of Majesty, Bounty and Honour.

\begin_layout Standard
When the Event inevitable cometh to pass,

\begin_layout Standard
Then will no (soul) entertain falsehood concerning its coming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Many) will it bring low; (many) will it exalt;

\begin_layout Standard
When the earth shall be shaken to its depths,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains shall be crumbled to atoms,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Becoming dust scattered abroad,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And ye shall be sorted out into three classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then (there will be) the Companions of the Right Hand;- What will be the
 Companions of the Right Hand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the
 Left Hand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those Foremost (in Faith) will be Foremost (in the Hereafter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These will be those Nearest to Allah:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Gardens of Bliss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of people from those of old,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a few from those of later times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(They will be) on Thrones encrusted (with gold and precious stones),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reclining on them, facing each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With goblets, (shining) beakers, and cups (filled) out of clear-flowing
 fountains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No after-ache will they receive therefrom, nor will they suffer intoxication:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with fruits, any that they may select:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (there will be) Companions with beautiful, big, and lustrous eyes,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like unto Pearls well-guarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Reward for the deeds of their past (life).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not frivolity will they hear therein, nor any taint of ill,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only the saying, "Peace! Peace".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Companions of the Right Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Right
 Hand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(They will be) among Lote-trees without thorns,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among Talh trees with flowers (or fruits) piled one above another,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In shade long-extended,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By water flowing constantly,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And fruit in abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whose season is not limited, nor (supply) forbidden,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And on Thrones (of Dignity), raised high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have created (their Companions) of special creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made them virgin - pure (and undefiled), -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beloved (by nature), equal in age,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Companions of the Right Hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A (goodly) number from those of old,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a (goodly) number from those of later times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Companions of the Left Hand,- what will be the Companions of the Left
 Hand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(They will be) in the midst of a Fierce Blast of Fire and in Boiling Water,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in the shades of Black Smoke:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing (will there be) to refresh, nor to please:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that they were wont to be indulged, before that, in wealth (and luxury),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And persisted obstinately in wickedness supreme!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they used to say, "What! when we die and become dust and bones, shall
 we then indeed be raised up again?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"(We) and our fathers of old?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "Yea, those of old and those of later times,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"All will certainly be gathered together for the meeting appointed for a
 Day well-known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Then will ye truly,- O ye that go wrong, and treat (Truth) as Falsehood!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Then will ye fill your insides therewith,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And drink Boiling Water on top of it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is We Who have created you: why will ye not witness the Truth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do ye then see?- The (human Seed) that ye throw out,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it ye who create it, or are We the Creators?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have decreed Death to be your common lot, and We are not to be frustrated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
from changing your Forms and creating you (again) in (forms) that ye know
 not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And ye certainly know already the first form of creation: why then do ye
 not celebrate His praises?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See ye the seed that ye sow in the ground?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it ye that cause it to grow, or are We the Cause?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry powder, and ye would be left
 in wonderment,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Saying), "We are indeed left with debts (for nothing):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Indeed are we shut out (of the fruits of our labour)"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See ye the water which ye drink?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do ye bring it down (in rain) from the cloud or do We?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Were it Our Will, We could make it salt (and unpalatable): then why do ye
 not give thanks?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See ye the Fire which ye kindle?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it ye who grow the tree which feeds the fire, or do We grow it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have made it a memorial (of Our handiwork), and an article of comfort
 and convenience for the denizens of deserts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore I call to witness the setting of the Stars,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that is indeed a mighty adjuration if ye but knew,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That this is indeed a qur'an Most Honourable,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Book well-guarded,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which none shall touch but those who are clean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is it such a Message that ye would hold in light esteem?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And have ye made it your livelihood that ye should declare it false?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then why do ye not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying man) reaches
 the throat,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And ye the while (sit) looking on,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But We are nearer to him than ye, and yet see not,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then why do ye not,- If you are exempt from (future) account,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call back the soul, if ye are true (in the claim of independence)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, then, if he be of those Nearest to Allah,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(There is for him) Rest and Satisfaction, and a Garden of Delights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if he be of the Companions of the Right Hand,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(For him is the salutation), "Peace be unto thee", from the Companions of
 the Right Hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if he be of those who treat (Truth) as Falsehood, who go wrong,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For him is Entertainment with Boiling Water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And burning in Hell-Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, this is the Very Truth and Certainly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So celebrate with praises the name of thy Lord, the Supreme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever is in the heavens and on earth,- let it declare the Praises and
 Glory of Allah: for He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: It is He Who gives
 Life and Death; and He has Power over all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full
 knowledge of all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and is moreover
 firmly established on the Throne (of Authority).
 He knows what enters within the earth and what comes forth out of it, what
 comes down from heaven and what mounts up to it.
 And He is with you wheresoever ye may be.
 And Allah sees well all that ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth: and all affairs
 are referred back to Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He merges Night into Day, and He merges Day into Night; and He has full
 knowledge of the secrets of (all) hearts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Believe in Allah and His messenger, and spend (in charity) out of the (substance
) whereof He has made you heirs.
 For, those of you who believe and spend (in charity),- for them is a great
 Reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What cause have ye why ye should not believe in Allah?- and the Messenger
 invites you to believe in your Lord, and has indeed taken your Covenant,
 if ye are men of Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He is the One Who sends to His Servant Manifest Signs, that He may lead
 you from the depths of Darkness into the Light and verily Allah is to you
 most kind and Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what cause have ye why ye should not spend in the cause of Allah?- For
 to Allah belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth.
 Not equal among you are those who spent (freely) and fought, before the
 Victory, (with those who did so later).
 Those are higher in rank than those who spent (freely) and fought afterwards.
 But to all has Allah promised a goodly (reward).
 And Allah is well acquainted with all that ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who is he that will Loan to Allah a beautiful loan? for (Allah) will increase
 it manifold to his credit, and he will have (besides) a liberal Reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Day shalt thou see the believing men and the believing women- how their
 Light runs forward before them and by their right hands: (their greeting
 will be): "Good News for you this Day! Gardens beneath which flow rivers!
 to dwell therein for aye! This is indeed the highest Achievement!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Day will the Hypocrites- men and women - say to the Believers: "Wait
 for us! Let us borrow (a Light) from your Light!" It will be said: "Turn
 ye back to your rear! then seek a Light (where ye can)!" So a wall will
 be put up betwixt them, with a gate therein.
 Within it will be Mercy throughout, and without it, all alongside, will
 be (Wrath and) Punishment!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Those without) will call out, "Were we not with you?" (The others) will
 reply, "True! but ye led yourselves into temptation; ye looked forward
 (to our ruin); ye doubted (Allah's Promise); and (your false) desires deceived
 you; until there issued the Command of Allah.
 And the Deceiver deceived you in respect of Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This Day shall no ransom be accepted of you, nor of those who rejected
 Allah." Your abode is the Fire: that is the proper place to claim you: and
 an evil refuge it is!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humility
 should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has been
 revealed (to them), and that they should not become like those to whom
 was given Revelation aforetime, but long ages passed over them and their
 hearts grew hard? For many among them are rebellious transgressors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Know ye (all) that Allah giveth life to the earth after its death! already
 have We shown the Signs plainly to you, that ye may learn wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those who give in Charity, men and women, and loan to Allah a Beautiful
 Loan, it shall be increased manifold (to their credit), and they shall
 have (besides) a liberal reward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who believe in Allah and His messengers- they are the Sincere
 (lovers of Truth), and the witnesses (who testify), in the eyes of their
 Lord: They shall have their Reward and their Light.
 But those who reject Allah and deny Our Signs,- they are the Companions
 of Hell-Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Know ye (all), that the life of this world is but play and amusement, pomp
 and mutual boasting and multiplying, (in rivalry) among yourselves, riches
 and children.
 Here is a similitude: How rain and the growth which it brings forth, delight
 (the hearts of) the tillers; soon it withers; thou wilt see it grow yellow;
 then it becomes dry and crumbles away.
 But in the Hereafter is a Penalty severe (for the devotees of wrong).
 And Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the devotees of
 Allah).
 And what is the life of this world, but goods and chattels of deception?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be ye foremost (in seeking) Forgiveness from your Lord, and a Garden (of
 Bliss), the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared
 for those who believe in Allah and His messengers: that is the Grace of
 Allah, which He bestows on whom he pleases: and Allah is the Lord of Grace
 abounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No misfortune can happen on earth or in your souls but is recorded in a
 decree before We bring it into existence: That is truly easy for Allah:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order that ye may not despair over matters that pass you by, nor exult
 over favours bestowed upon you.
 For Allah loveth not any vainglorious boaster,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such persons as are covetous and commend covetousness to men.
 And if any turn back (from Allah's Way), verily Allah is Free of all Needs,
 Worthy of all Praise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We sent aforetime our messengers with Clear Signs and sent down with them
 the Book and the Balance (of Right and Wrong), that men may stand forth
 in justice; and We sent down Iron, in which is (material for) mighty war,
 as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allah may test who it is that
 will help, Unseen, Him and His messengers: For Allah is Full of Strength,
 Exalted in Might (and able to enforce His Will).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood
 and Revelation: and some of them were on right guidance.
 But many of them became rebellious transgressors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, in their wake, We followed them up with (others of) Our messengers:
 We sent after them Jesus the son of Mary, and bestowed on him the Gospel;
 and We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him Compassion and
 Mercy.
 But the Monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe
 for them: (We commanded) only the seeking for the Good Pleasure of Allah;
 but that they did not foster as they should have done.
 Yet We bestowed, on those among them who believed, their (due) reward,
 but many of them are rebellious transgressors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O ye that believe! Fear Allah, and believe in His Messenger, and He will
 bestow on you a double portion of His Mercy: He will provide for you a
 Light by which ye shall walk (straight in your path), and He will forgive
 you (your past): for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That the People of the Book may know that they have no power whatever over
 the Grace of Allah, that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand, to bestow
 it on whomsoever He wills.
 For Allah is the Lord of Grace abounding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah has indeed heard (and accepted) the statement of the woman who pleads
 with thee concerning her husband and carries her complaint (in prayer)
 to Allah: and Allah (always) hears the arguments between both sides among
 you: for Allah hears and sees (all things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If any men among you divorce their wives by Zihar (calling them mothers),
 they cannot be their mothers: None can be their mothers except those who
 gave them birth.
 And in fact they use words (both) iniquitous and false: but truly Allah

O Prophet! When ye do divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed periods,
 and count (accurately), their prescribed periods: And fear Allah your Lord:
 and turn them not out of their houses, nor shall they (themselves) leave,
 except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness, those are limits
 set by Allah: and any who transgresses the limits of Allah, does verily
 wrong his (own) soul: thou knowest not if perchance Allah will bring about
 thereafter some new situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus when they fulfil their term appointed, either take them back on equitable
 terms or part with them on equitable terms; and take for witness two persons

 Such is the admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last
 Day.
 And for those who fear Allah, He (ever) prepares a way out,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He provides for him from (sources) he never could imagine.
 And if any one puts his trust in Allah, sufficient is (Allah) for him.
 For Allah will surely accomplish his purpose: verily, for all things has
 Allah appointed a due proportion.

\begin_layout Standard
Such of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the
 prescribed period, if ye have any doubts, is three months, and for those
 who have no courses (it is the same): for those who carry (life within
 their wombs), their period is until they deliver their burdens: and for
 those who fear Allah, He will make their path easy.
\end_layout

That is the Command of Allah, which He has sent down to you: and if any

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the women live (in 'iddat) in the same style as ye live, according to
 your means: Annoy them not, so as to restrict them.
 And if they carry (life in their wombs), then spend (your substance) on
 them until they deliver their burden: and if they suckle your (offspring),
 give them their recompense: and take mutual counsel together, according
 to what is just and reasonable.
 And if ye find yourselves in difficulties, let another woman suckle (the
 child) on the (father's) behalf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the man of means spend according to his means: and the man whose resources

Allah sets forth, for an example to the Unbelievers, the wife of Noah and

 Allah on their account, but were told: "Enter ye the Fire along with (others)
 that enter!"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Go ye to your tilth (betimes) in the morning, if ye would gather the fruits."

\begin_layout Standard
And no friend will ask after a friend,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though they will be put in sight of each other,- the sinner's desire will
 be: Would that he could redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by
 (sacrificing) his children,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His wife and his brother,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His kindred who sheltered him,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plucking out (his being) right to the skull!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inviting (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces (from
 the Right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And collect (wealth) and hide it (from use)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly man was created very impatient;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fretful when evil touches him;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And niggardly when good reaches him;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not so those devoted to Prayer;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who remain steadfast to their prayer;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those in whose wealth is a recognised right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the (needy) who asks and him who is prevented (for some reason from
 asking);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who hold to the truth of the Day of Judgment;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who fear the displeasure of their Lord,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For their Lord's displeasure is the opposite of Peace and Tranquillity;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who guard their chastity,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except with their wives and the (captives) whom their right hands possess,-
 for (then) they are not to be blamed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those who trespass beyond this are transgressors;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who respect their trusts and covenants;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who stand firm in their testimonies;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And those who guard (the sacredness) of their worship;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such will be the honoured ones in the Gardens (of Bliss).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now what is the matter with the Unbelievers that they rush madly before
 thee-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the right and from the left, in crowds?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! For We have created them out of the (base matter) they know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West
 that We can certainly-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substitute for them better (men) than they; And We are not to be defeated
 (in Our Plan).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So leave them to plunge in vain talk and play about, until they encounter
 that Day of theirs which they have been promised!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day whereon they will issue from their sepulchres in sudden haste as
 if they were rushing to a goal-post (fixed for them),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their eyes lowered in dejection,- ignominy covering them (all over)! such
 is the Day the which they are promised!

\begin_layout Standard
We sent Noah to his People (with the Command): "Do thou warn thy People
 before there comes to them a grievous Penalty."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my People! I am to you a Warner, clear and open:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That ye should worship Allah, fear Him and obey me:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So He may forgive you your sins and give you respite for a stated Term:
 for when the Term given by Allah is accomplished, it cannot be put forward:
 if ye only knew."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He said: "O my Lord! I have called to my People night and day:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But my call only increases (their) flight (from the Right).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And every time I have called to them, that Thou mightest forgive them,
 they have (only) thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves
 up with their garments, grown obstinate, and given themselves up to arrogance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So I have called to them aloud;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Further I have spoken to them in public and secretly in private,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Saying, 'Ask forgiveness from your Lord; for He is Oft-Forgiving;

 Lamp?

Noah said: "O my Lord! They have disobeyed me, but they follow (men) whose
 wealth and children give them no increase but only Loss.

\begin_layout Standard
"And they have devised a tremendous Plot.

 Wadd nor Suwa', neither Yaguth nor Ya'uq, nor Nasr';-

\begin_layout Standard
"They have already misled many; and grant Thou no increase to the wrong-doers
 but in straying (from their mark)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of their sins they were drowned (in the flood), and were made to
 enter the Fire (of Punishment): and they found- in lieu of Allah- none
 to help them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Noah, said: "O my Lord! Leave not of the Unbelievers, a single one on
 earth!

\begin_layout Standard
"For, if Thou dost leave (any of) them, they will but mislead Thy devotees,
 and they will breed none but wicked ungrateful ones.

 (all) believing men and believing women: and to the wrong-doers grant Thou
 no increase but in perdition!"

\begin_layout Standard
Say: It has been revealed to me that a company of Jinns listened (to the
 Qur'an).
 They said, 'We have really heard a wonderful Recital!

'It gives guidance to the Right, and we have believed therein: we shall
 not join (in worship) any (gods) with our Lord.

 Allah.

 their Lord (really) intends to guide them to right conduct.

\begin_layout Standard
'Amongst us are some that submit their wills (to Allah), and some that swerve

 Now those who submit their wills - they have sought out (the path) of right
 conduct:

\begin_layout Standard
'But those who swerve,- they are (but) fuel for Hell-fire'-

Say: "I do no more than invoke my Lord, and I join not with Him any (false

\begin_layout Standard
Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to right

At length, when they see (with their own eyes) that which they are promised,-
 then will they know who it is that is weakest in (his) helper and least

Say: "I know not whether the (Punishment) which ye are promised is near,

"He (alone) knows the Unseen, nor does He make any one acquainted with His

O thou folded in garments!

Stand (to prayer) by night, but not all night,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half of it,- or a little less,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or a little more; and recite the Qur'an in slow, measured rhythmic tones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon shall We send down to thee a weighty Message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly the rising by night is most potent for governing (the soul), and most
 suitable for (framing) the Word (of Prayer and Praise).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
True, there is for thee by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties:

\begin_layout Standard
But keep in remembrance the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him whole-hea
rtedly.

\begin_layout Standard
(He is) Lord of the East and the West: there is no god but He: take Him
 therefore for (thy) Disposer of Affairs.

\begin_layout Standard
And have patience with what they say, and leave them with noble (dignity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And leave Me (alone to deal with) those in possession of the good things
 of life, who (yet) deny the Truth; and bear with them for a little while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Us are Fetters (to bind them), and a Fire (to burn them),

One Day the earth and the mountains will be in violent commotion.
 And the mountains will be as a heap of sand poured out and flowing down.

\begin_layout Standard
We have sent to you, (O men!) a messenger, to be a witness concerning you,
 even as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger; so We seized him with a heavy Punishment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then how shall ye, if ye deny (Allah), guard yourselves against a Day that
 will make children hoary-headed?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereon the sky will be cleft asunder? His Promise needs must be accomplished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily this is an Admonition: therefore, whoso will, let him take a (straight)
 path to his Lord!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thy Lord doth know that thou standest forth (to prayer) nigh two-thirds
 of the night, or half the night, or a third of the night, and so doth a
 party of those with thee.
 But Allah doth appoint night and day in due measure He knoweth that ye
 are unable to keep count thereof.
 So He hath turned to you (in mercy): read ye, therefore, of the Qur'an
 as much as may be easy for you.
 He knoweth that there may be (some) among you in ill-health; others travelling
 through the land, seeking of Allah's bounty; yet others fighting in Allah's
 Cause, read ye, therefore, as much of the Qur'an as may be easy (for you);
 and establish regular Prayer and give regular Charity; and loan to Allah
 a Beautiful Loan.
 And whatever good ye send forth for your souls ye shall find it in Allah's
 Presence,- yea, better and greater, in Reward and seek ye the Grace of
 Allah: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O thou wrapped up (in the mantle)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arise and deliver thy warning!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thy Lord do thou magnify!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thy garments keep free from stain!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all abomination shun!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor expect, in giving, any increase (for thyself)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, for thy Lord's (Cause), be patient and constant!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, when the Trumpet is sounded,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will be- that Day - a Day of Distress,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Far from easy for those without Faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leave Me alone, (to deal) with the (creature) whom I created (bare and)
 alone!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To whom I granted resources in abundance,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And sons to be by his side!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To whom I made (life) smooth and comfortable!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet is he greedy-that I should add (yet more);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! For to Our Signs he has been refractory!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will I visit him with a mount of calamities!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For he thought and he plotted;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And woe to him! How he plotted!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, Woe to him; How he plotted!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he looked round;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he frowned and he scowled;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he turned back and was haughty;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then said he: "This is nothing but magic, derived from of old;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"This is nothing but the word of a mortal!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will I cast him into Hell-Fire!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what Hell-Fire is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naught doth it permit to endure, and naught doth it leave alone!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Darkening and changing the colour of man!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over it are Nineteen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We have set none but angels as Guardians of the Fire; and We have fixed
 their number only as a trial for Unbelievers,- in order that the People
 of the Book may arrive at certainty, and the Believers may increase in
 Faith,- and that no doubts may be left for the People of the Book and the
 Believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the Unbelievers
 may say, "What symbol doth Allah intend by this?" Thus doth Allah leave
 to stray whom He pleaseth, and guide whom He pleaseth: and none can know
 the forces of thy Lord, except He and this is no other than a warning to
 mankind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, verily: By the Moon,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Night as it retreateth,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Dawn as it shineth forth,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is but one of the mighty (portents),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A warning to mankind,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To any of you that chooses to press forward, or to follow behind;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every soul will be (held) in pledge for its deeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except the Companions of the Right Hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(They will be) in Gardens (of Delight): they will question each other,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (ask) of the Sinners:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What led you into Hell Fire?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will say: "We were not of those who prayed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nor were we of those who fed the indigent;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But we used to talk vanities with vain talkers;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And we used to deny the Day of Judgment,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Until there came to us (the Hour) that is certain."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then will no intercession of (any) intercessors profit them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then what is the matter with them that they turn away from admonition?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As if they were affrighted asses,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fleeing from a lion!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forsooth, each one of them wants to be given scrolls (of revelation) spread
 out!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! But they fear not the Hereafter,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, this surely is an admonition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let any who will, keep it in remembrance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But none will keep it in remembrance except as Allah wills: He is the Lord
 of Righteousness, and the Lord of Forgiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do call to witness the Resurrection Day;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit: (Eschew Evil).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does man think that We cannot assemble his bones?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, We are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But man wishes to do wrong (even) in the time in front of him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He questions: "When is the Day of Resurrection?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, when the sight is dazed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the moon is buried in darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the sun and moon are joined together,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day will Man say: "Where is the refuge?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! No place of safety!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before thy Lord (alone), that Day will be the place of rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day will Man be told (all) that he put forward, and all that he put
 back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, man will be evidence against himself,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though he were to put up his excuses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur'an) to make haste therewith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital (as promulgated):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay more, it is for Us to explain it (and make it clear):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, (ye men!) but ye love the fleeting life,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And leave alone the Hereafter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some faces, that Day, will beam (in brightness and beauty);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking towards their Lord;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And some faces, that Day, will be sad and dismal,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the thought that some back-breaking calamity was about to be inflicted
 on them;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yea, when (the soul) reaches to the collar-bone (in its exit),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there will be a cry, "Who is a magician (to restore him)?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he will conclude that it was (the Time) of Parting;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And one leg will be joined with another:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day the Drive will be (all) to thy Lord!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he gave nothing in charity, nor did he pray!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But on the contrary, he rejected Truth and turned away!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did he stalk to his family in full conceit!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, Woe to thee, (O men!), yea, woe!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does man think that he will be left uncontrolled, (without purpose)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Was he not a drop of sperm emitted (in lowly form)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did he become a leech-like clot; then did (Allah) make and fashion
 (him) in due proportion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And of him He made two sexes, male and female.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has not He, (the same), the power to give life to the dead?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has there not been over Man a long period of Time, when he was nothing -
 (not even) mentioned?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily We created Man from a drop of mingled sperm, in order to try him:
 So We gave him (the gifts), of Hearing and Sight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We showed him the Way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his
 will).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Rejecters we have prepared chains, yokes, and a blazing Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the Righteous, they shall drink of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Kafur,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Fountain where the Devotees of Allah do drink, making it flow in unstinted
 abundance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They perform (their) vows, and they fear a Day whose evil flies far and
 wide.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they feed, for the love of Allah, the indigent, the orphan, and the
 captive,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Saying),"We feed you for the sake of Allah alone: no reward do we desire
 from you, nor thanks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We only fear a Day of distressful Wrath from the side of our Lord."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Allah will deliver them from the evil of that Day, and will shed over
 them a Light of Beauty and (blissful) Joy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And because they were patient and constant, He will reward them with a Garden
 and (garments of) silk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reclining in the (Garden) on raised thrones, they will see there neither
 the sun's (excessive heat) nor (the moon's) excessive cold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the shades of the (Garden) will come low over them, and the bunches
 (of fruit), there, will hang low in humility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And amongst them will be passed round vessels of silver and goblets of crystal,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crystal-clear, made of silver: they will determine the measure thereof (accordin
g to their wishes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they will be given to drink there of a Cup (of Wine) mixed with Zanjabil,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fountain there, called Salsabil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And round about them will (serve) youths of perpetual (freshness): If thou
 seest them, thou wouldst think them scattered Pearls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when thou lookest, it is there thou wilt see a Bliss and a Realm Magnificent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon them will be green Garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, and they
 will be adorned with Bracelets of silver; and their Lord will give to them
 to drink of a Wine Pure and Holy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Verily this is a Reward for you, and your Endeavour is accepted and recognised."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is We Who have sent down the Qur'an to thee by stages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore be patient with constancy to the Command of thy Lord, and hearken
 not to the sinner or the ingrate among them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And celebrate the name of thy Lord morning and evening,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And part of the night, prostrate thyself to Him; and glorify Him a long
 night through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to these, they love the fleeting life, and put away behind them a Day
 (that will be) hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is We Who created them, and We have made their joints strong; but, when
 We will, We can substitute the like of them by a complete change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an admonition: Whosoever will, let him take a (straight) Path to
 his Lord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But ye will not, except as Allah wills; for Allah is full of Knowledge and
 Wisdom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He will admit to His Mercy whom He will; But the wrong-doers,- for them
 has He prepared a grievous Penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the (Winds) sent forth one after another (to man's profit);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which then blow violently in tempestuous Gusts,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And scatter (things) far and wide;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then separate them, one from another,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then spread abroad a Message,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether of Justification or of Warning;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuredly, what ye are promised must come to pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then when the stars become dim;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the heaven is cleft asunder;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mountains are scattered (to the winds) as dust;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the messengers are (all) appointed a time (to collect);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what Day are these (portents) deferred?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Day of Sorting out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what is the Day of Sorting out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did We not destroy the men of old (for their evil)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So shall We make later (generations) follow them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus do We deal with men of sin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have We not created you from a fluid (held) despicable?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The which We placed in a place of rest, firmly fixed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a period (of gestation), determined (according to need)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For We do determine (according to need); for We are the best to determine
 (things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day! to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have We not made the earth (as a place) to draw together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The living and the dead,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made therein mountains standing firm, lofty (in stature); and provided
 for you water sweet (and wholesome)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It will be said:) "Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Depart ye to a Shadow (of smoke ascending) in three columns,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"(Which yields) no shade of coolness, and is of no use against the fierce
 Blaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Indeed it throws about sparks (huge) as Forts,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"As if there were (a string of) yellow camels (marching swiftly)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will be a Day of Sorting out! We shall gather you together and those
 before (you)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, if ye have a trick (or plot), use it against Me!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to the Righteous, they shall be amidst (cool) shades and springs (of
 water).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (they shall have) fruits,- all they desire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Eat ye and drink ye to your heart's content: for that ye worked (Righteousness).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus do We certainly reward the Doers of Good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(O ye unjust!) Eat ye and enjoy yourselves (but) a little while, for that
 ye are Sinners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when it is said to them, "Prostrate yourselves!" they do not so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then what Message, after that, will they believe in?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning what are they disputing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning the Great News,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About which they cannot agree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, they shall soon (come to) know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, verily they shall soon (come to) know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains as pegs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (have We not) created you in pairs,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made your sleep for rest,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made the night as a covering,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And made the day as a means of subsistence?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (have We not) built over you the seven firmaments,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And placed (therein) a Light of Splendour?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That We may produce therewith corn and vegetables,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And gardens of luxurious growth?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily the Day of Sorting out is a thing appointed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day that the Trumpet shall be sounded, and ye shall come forth in crowds;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the heavens shall be opened as if there were doors,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains shall vanish, as if they were a mirage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly Hell is as a place of ambush,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the transgressors a place of destination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will dwell therein for ages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Save a boiling fluid and a fluid, dark, murky, intensely cold,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fitting recompense (for them).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that they used not to fear any account (for their deeds),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they (impudently) treated Our Signs as false.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And all things have We preserved on record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So taste ye (the fruits of your deeds); for no increase shall We grant
 you, except in Punishment."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily for the Righteous there will be a fulfilment of (the heart's) desires;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gardens enclosed, and grapevines;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And voluptuous women of equal age;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a cup full (to the brim).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No vanity shall they hear therein, nor Untruth:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recompense from thy Lord, a gift, (amply) sufficient,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(From) the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all between, (Allah) Most
 Gracious: None shall have power to argue with Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand forth in ranks, none shall
 speak except any who is permitted by (Allah) Most Gracious, and He will
 say what is right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day will be the sure Reality: Therefore, whoso will, let him take a
 (straight) return to his Lord!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, We have warned you of a Penalty near, the Day when man will see
 (the deeds) which his hands have sent forth, and the Unbeliever will say,
 "Woe unto me! Would that I were (metre) dust!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the (angels) who tear out (the souls of the wicked) with violence;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By those who gently draw out (the souls of the blessed);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by those who glide along (on errands of mercy),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then press forward as in a race,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then arrange to do (the Commands of their Lord),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One Day everything that can be in commotion will be in violent commotion,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Followed by oft-repeated (commotions):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hearts that Day will be in agitation;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cast down will be (their owners') eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They say (now): "What! shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What! - when we shall have become rotten bones?"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They say: "It would, in that case, be a return with loss!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But verily, it will be but a single (Compelling) Cry,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When, behold, they will be in the (full) awakening (to Judgment).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has the story of Moses reached thee?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, thy Lord did call to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Go thou to Pharaoh for he has indeed transgressed all bounds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And say to him, 'Wouldst thou that thou shouldst be purified (from sin)?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"'And that I guide thee to thy Lord, so thou shouldst fear Him?'"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did (Moses) show him the Great Sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed (guidance);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, he turned his back, striving hard (against Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he collected (his men) and made a proclamation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Saying, "I am your Lord, Most High".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Allah did punish him, (and made an) example of him, - in the Hereafter,
 as in this life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily in this is an instructive warning for whosoever feareth (Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What! Are ye the more difficult to create or the heaven (above)? (Allah)
 hath constructed it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On high hath He raised its canopy, and He hath given it order and perfection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its night doth He endow with darkness, and its splendour doth He bring out
 (with light).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the earth, moreover, hath He extended (to a wide expanse);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He draweth out therefrom its moisture and its pasture;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains hath He firmly fixed;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For use and convenience to you and your cattle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when there comes the great, overwhelming (Event),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day when man shall remember (all) that he strove for,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Hell-Fire shall be placed in full view for (all) to see,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, for such as had transgressed all bounds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And had preferred the life of this world,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Abode will be Hell-Fire;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And for such as had entertained the fear of standing before their Lord's
 (tribunal) and had restrained (their) soul from lower desires,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their abode will be the Garden.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They ask thee about the Hour,-'When will be its appointed time?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherein art thou (concerned) with the declaration thereof?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With thy Lord in the Limit fixed therefor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thou art but a Warner for such as fear it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day they see it, (It will be) as if they had tarried but a single evening,
 or (at most till) the following morn!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The Prophet) frowned and turned away,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there came to him the blind man (interrupting).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what could tell thee but that perchance he might grow (in spiritual
 understanding)?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or that he might receive admonition, and the teaching might profit him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As to one who regards Himself as self-sufficient,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To him dost thou attend;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though it is no blame to thee if he grow not (in spiritual understanding).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But as to him who came to thee striving earnestly,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with fear (in his heart),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of him wast thou unmindful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means (should it be so)! For it is indeed a Message of instruction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore let whoso will, keep it in remembrance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) in Books held (greatly) in honour,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exalted (in dignity), kept pure and holy,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Written) by the hands of scribes-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Honourable and Pious and Just.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe to man! What hath made him reject Allah;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From what stuff hath He created him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a sperm-drop: He hath created him, and then mouldeth him in due proportions
;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then doth He make His path smooth for him;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then He causeth him to die, and putteth him in his grave;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, when it is His Will, He will raise him up (again).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means hath he fulfilled what Allah hath commanded him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then let man look at his food, (and how We provide it):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that We pour forth water in abundance,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We split the earth in fragments,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And produce therein corn,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Grapes and nutritious plants,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Olives and Dates,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And enclosed Gardens, dense with lofty trees,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And fruits and fodder,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For use and convenience to you and your cattle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At length, when there comes the Deafening Noise,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That Day shall a man flee from his own brother,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And from his mother and his father,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And from his wife and his children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern (of his own) to make
 him indifferent to the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some faces that Day will be beaming,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Laughing, rejoicing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And other faces that Day will be dust-stained,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blackness will cover them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the sun (with its spacious light) is folded up;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the stars fall, losing their lustre;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the mountains vanish (like a mirage);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the she-camels, ten months with young, are left untended;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the wild beasts are herded together (in the human habitations);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the oceans boil over with a swell;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the souls are sorted out, (being joined, like with like);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the female (infant), buried alive, is questioned -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For what crime she was killed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the scrolls are laid open;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the world on High is unveiled;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Blazing Fire is kindled to fierce heat;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the Garden is brought near;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Then) shall each soul know what it has put forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So verily I call to witness the planets - that recede,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go straight, or hide;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Night as it dissipates;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Dawn as it breathes away the darkness;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily this is the word of a most honourable Messenger,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Endued with Power, with rank before the Lord of the Throne,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With authority there, (and) faithful to his trust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (O people!) your companion is not one possessed;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And without doubt he saw him in the clear horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither doth he withhold grudgingly a knowledge of the Unseen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor is it the word of an evil spirit accursed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When whither go ye?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily this is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But ye shall not will except as Allah wills,- the Cherisher of the Worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Sky is cleft asunder;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Stars are scattered;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Oceans are suffered to burst forth;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the Graves are turned upside down;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Then) shall each soul know what it hath sent forward and (what it hath)
 kept back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O man! What has seduced thee from thy Lord Most Beneficent?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Him Who created thee.
 Fashioned thee in due proportion, and gave thee a just bias;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In whatever Form He wills, does He put thee together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay! But ye do reject Right and Judgment!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But verily over you (are appointed angels) to protect you,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Kind and honourable,- Writing down (your deeds):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They know (and understand) all that ye do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the Righteous, they will be in bliss;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Wicked - they will be in the Fire,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which they will enter on the Day of Judgment,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they will not be able to keep away therefrom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, what will explain to thee what the Day of Judgment is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It will be) the Day when no soul shall have power (to do) aught for another:
 For the command, that Day, will be (wholly) with Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe to those that deal in fraud,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, exact full measure,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do they not think that they will be called to account?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a Mighty Day,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay! Surely the record of the wicked is (preserved) in Sijjin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what Sijjin is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(There is) a Register (fully) inscribed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe, that Day, to those that deny-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those that deny the Day of Judgment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And none can deny it but the Transgressor beyond bounds the Sinner!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Our Signs are rehearsed to him, he says, "Tales of the ancients!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! but on their hearts is the stain of the (ill) which they do!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, from (the Light of) their Lord, that Day, will they be veiled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, they will enter the Fire of Hell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, it will be said to them: "This is the (reality) which ye rejected
 as false!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, verily the record of the Righteous is (preserved) in 'Illiyin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what 'Illiyun is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(There is) a Register (fully) inscribed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To which bear witness those Nearest (to Allah).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly the Righteous will be in Bliss:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Thrones (of Dignity) will they command a sight (of all things):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thou wilt recognise in their faces the beaming brightness of Bliss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their thirst will be slaked with Pure Wine sealed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seal thereof will be Musk: And for this let those aspire, who have aspiratio
ns:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With it will be (given) a mixture of Tasnim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spring, from (the waters) whereof drink those Nearest to Allah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And whenever they passed by them, used to wink at each other (in mockery);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And whenever they saw them, they would say, "Behold! These are the people
 truly astray!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But they had not been sent as keepers over them!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But on this Day the Believers will laugh at the Unbelievers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Thrones (of Dignity) they will command (a sight) (of all things).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will not the Unbelievers have been paid back for what they did?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the sky is rent asunder,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord, and it must needs (do so);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the earth is flattened out,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And casts forth what is within it and becomes (clean) empty,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord,- and it must needs (do so);-
 (then will come Home the full reality).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully
 toiling,- but thou shalt meet Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then he who is given his Record in his right hand,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will his account be taken by an easy reckoning,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he will turn to his people, rejoicing!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he who is given his Record behind his back,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon will he cry for perdition,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he will enter a Blazing Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly, did he go about among his people, rejoicing!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly, did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, nay! for his Lord was (ever) watchful of him!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Night and its Homing;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Moon in her fullness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ye shall surely travel from stage to stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What then is the matter with them, that they believe not?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when the Qur'an is read to them, they fall not prostrate,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But on the contrary the Unbelievers reject (it).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Allah has full knowledge of what they secrete (in their breasts)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So announce to them a Penalty Grievous,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except to those who believe and work righteous deeds: For them is a Reward
 that will never fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the sky, (displaying) the Zodiacal Signs;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the promised Day (of Judgment);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By one that witnesses, and the subject of the witness;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe to the makers of the pit (of fire),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire supplied (abundantly) with fuel:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold! they sat over against the (fire),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they witnessed (all) that they were doing against the Believers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they ill-treated them for no other reason than that they believed in
 Allah, Exalted in Power, Worthy of all Praise!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah
 is Witness to all things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who persecute (or draw into temptation) the Believers, men and women,
 and do not turn in repentance, will have the Penalty of Hell: They will
 have the Penalty of the Burning Fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For those who believe and do righteous deeds, will be Gardens; beneath which
 rivers flow: That is the great Salvation, (the fulfilment of all desires),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly strong is the Grip (and Power) of thy Lord.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is He Who creates from the very beginning, and He can restore (life).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He is the Oft-Forgiving, Full of Loving-Kindness,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lord of the Throne of Glory,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Doer (without let) of all that He intends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has the story reached thee, of the forces-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of Pharaoh and the Thamud?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet the Unbelievers (persist) in rejecting (the Truth)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Allah doth encompass them from behind!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, this is a Glorious Qur'an,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Inscribed) in a Tablet Preserved!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Sky and the Night-Visitant (therein);-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what the Night-Visitant is?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) the Star of piercing brightness;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no soul but has a protector over it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let man but think from what he is created!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He is created from a drop emitted-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surely (Allah) is able to bring him back (to life)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Day that (all) things secret will be tested,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Man) will have no power, and no helper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Firmament which returns (in its round),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Earth which opens out (for the gushing of springs or the sprouting
 of vegetation),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold this is the Word that distinguishes (Good from Evil):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not a thing for amusement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for them, they are but plotting a scheme,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I am planning a scheme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore grant a delay to the Unbelievers: Give respite to them gently
 (for awhile).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glorify the name of thy Guardian-Lord Most High,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who hath created, and further, given order and proportion;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who hath ordained laws.
 And granted guidance;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Who bringeth out the (green and luscious) pasture,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then doth make it (but) swarthy stubble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message), so thou shalt not
 forget,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except as Allah wills: For He knoweth what is manifest and what is hidden.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And We will make it easy for thee (to follow) the simple (Path).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore give admonition in case the admonition profits (the hearer).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The admonition will be received by those who fear (Allah):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it will be avoided by those most unfortunate ones,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who will enter the Great Fire,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In which they will then neither die nor live.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those will prosper who purify themselves,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And glorify the name of their Guardian-Lord, and (lift their hearts) in
 prayer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay (behold), ye prefer the life of this world;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Hereafter is better and more enduring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this is in the Books of the earliest (Revelation),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Books of Abraham and Moses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Has the story reached thee of the overwhelming (Event)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some faces, that Day, will be humiliated,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labouring (hard), weary,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The while they enter the Blazing Fire,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The while they are given, to drink, of a boiling hot spring,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Other) faces that Day will be joyful,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pleased with their striving,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a Garden on high,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where they shall hear no (word) of vanity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein will be a bubbling spring:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein will be Thrones (of dignity), raised on high,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Goblets placed (ready),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And cushions set in rows,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And rich carpets (all) spread out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do they not look at the Camels, how they are made?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And at the Sky, how it is raised high?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And at the Mountains, how they are fixed firm?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And at the Earth, how it is spread out?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore do thou give admonition, for thou art one to admonish.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thou art not one to manage (men's) affairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if any turn away and reject Allah,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah will punish him with a mighty Punishment,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For to Us will be their return;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it will be for Us to call them to account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the break of Day
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Nights twice five;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the even and odd (contrasted);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Night when it passeth away;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is there (not) in these an adjuration (or evidence) for those who understand?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the 'Ad (people),-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the (city of) Iram, with lofty pillars,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The like of which were not produced in (all) the land?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with the Thamud (people), who cut out (huge) rocks in the valley?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And with Pharaoh, lord of stakes?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(All) these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And heaped therein mischief (on mischief).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore did thy Lord pour on them a scourge of diverse chastisements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For thy Lord is (as a Guardian) on a watch-tower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, as for man, when his Lord trieth him, giving him honour and gifts,
 then saith he, (puffed up), "My Lord hath honoured me."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when He trieth him, restricting his subsistence for him, then saith
 he (in despair), "My Lord hath humiliated me!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, nay! but ye honour not the orphans!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor do ye encourage one another to feed the poor!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And ye devour inheritance - all with greed,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And ye love wealth with inordinate love!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay! When the earth is pounded to powder,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thy Lord cometh, and His angels, rank upon rank,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Hell, that Day, is brought (face to face),- on that Day will man remember,
 but how will that remembrance profit him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He will say: "Ah! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my
 (Future) Life!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For, that Day, His Chastisement will be such as none (else) can inflict,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And His bonds will be such as none (other) can bind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(To the righteous soul will be said:) "O (thou) soul, in (complete) rest
 and satisfaction!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Come back thou to thy Lord,- well pleased (thyself), and well-pleasing
 unto Him!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Enter thou, then, among My devotees!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yea, enter thou My Heaven!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do call to witness this City;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thou art a freeman of this City;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (the mystic ties of) parent and child;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily We have created man into toil and struggle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinketh he, that none hath power over him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He may say (boastfully); Wealth have I squandered in abundance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinketh he that none beholdeth him?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have We not made for him a pair of eyes?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a tongue, and a pair of lips?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And shown him the two highways?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he hath made no haste on the path that is steep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee the path that is steep?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is:) freeing the bondman;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or the giving of food in a day of privation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the orphan with claims of relationship,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or to the indigent (down) in the dust.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then will he be of those who believe, and enjoin patience, (constancy, and
 self-restraint), and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such are the Companions of the Right Hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those who reject Our Signs, they are the (unhappy) Companions of the
 Left Hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On them will be Fire vaulted over (all round).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Sun and his (glorious) splendour;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Moon as she follows him;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Day as it shows up (the Sun's) glory;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Night as it conceals it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Firmament and its (wonderful) structure;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Earth and its (wide) expanse:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Soul, and the proportion and order given to it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And its enlightenment as to its wrong and its right;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly he succeeds that purifies it,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he fails that corrupts it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Thamud (people) rejected (their prophet) through their inordinate wrong-doin
g,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behold, the most wicked man among them was deputed (for impiety).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the Messenger of Allah said to them: "It is a She-camel of Allah! And
 (bar her not from) having her drink!"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then they rejected him (as a false prophet), and they hamstrung her.
 So their Lord, on account of their crime, obliterated their traces and
 made them equal (in destruction, high and low)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And for Him is no fear of its consequences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Night as it conceals (the light);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Day as it appears in glory;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By (the mystery of) the creation of male and female;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, (the ends) ye strive for are diverse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he who gives (in charity) and fears (Allah),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And (in all sincerity) testifies to the best,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Bliss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he who is a greedy miser and thinks himself self-sufficient,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And gives the lie to the best,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will indeed make smooth for him the path to Misery;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor will his wealth profit him when he falls headlong (into the Pit).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily We take upon Ourselves to guide,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And verily unto Us (belong) the End and the Beginning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore do I warn you of a Fire blazing fiercely;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None shall reach it but those most unfortunate ones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who give the lie to Truth and turn their backs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But those most devoted to Allah shall be removed far from it,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who spend their wealth for increase in self-purification,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And have in their minds no favour from anyone for which a reward is expected
 in return,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But only the desire to seek for the Countenance of their Lord Most High;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And soon will they attain (complete) satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Glorious Morning Light,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And by the Night when it is still,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And verily the Hereafter will be better for thee than the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And soon will thy Guardian-Lord give thee (that wherewith) thou shalt be
 well-pleased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did He not find thee an orphan and give thee shelter (and care)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He found thee wandering, and He gave thee guidance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He found thee in need, and made thee independent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, treat not the orphan with harshness,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor repulse the petitioner (unheard);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the bounty of the Lord - rehearse and proclaim!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Have We not expanded thee thy breast?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And removed from thee thy burden
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The which did gall thy back?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And raised high the esteem (in which) thou (art held)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, verily, with every difficulty, there is relief:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, with every difficulty there is relief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, when thou art free (from thine immediate task), still labour
 hard,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to thy Lord turn (all) thy attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Fig and the Olive,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the Mount of Sinai,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this City of security,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have indeed created man in the best of moulds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then do We abase him (to be) the lowest of the low,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except such as believe and do righteous deeds: For they shall have a reward
 unfailing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then what can, after this, contradict thee, as to the judgment (to come)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is not Allah the wisest of judges?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He Who taught (the use of) the pen,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taught man that which he knew not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, but man doth transgress all bounds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that he looketh upon himself as self-sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily, to thy Lord is the return (of all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou one who forbids-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A votary when he (turns) to pray?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou if he is on (the road of) Guidance?-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or enjoins Righteousness?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou if he denies (Truth) and turns away?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knoweth he not that Allah doth see?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let him beware! If he desist not, We will drag him by the forelock,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lying, sinful forelock!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, let him call (for help) to his council (of comrades):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will call on the angels of punishment (to deal with him)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, heed him not: But bow down in adoration, and bring thyself the closer
 (to Allah)!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have indeed revealed this (Message) in the Night of Power:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what the night of power is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therein come down the angels and the Spirit by Allah's permission, on every
 errand:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peace!...
 This until the rise of morn!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists
, were not going to depart (from their ways) until there should come to
 them Clear Evidence,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An messenger from Allah, rehearsing scriptures kept pure and holy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wherein are laws (or decrees) right and straight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor did the People of the Book make schisms, until after there came to them
 Clear Evidence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they have been commanded no more than this: To worship Allah, offering
 Him sincere devotion, being true (in faith); to establish regular prayer;
 and to practise regular charity; and that is the Religion Right and Straight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists
, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein (for aye).
 They are the worst of creatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who have faith and do righteous deeds,- they are the best of creatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their reward is with Allah: Gardens of Eternity, beneath which rivers flow;
 they will dwell therein for ever; Allah well pleased with them, and they
 with Him: all this for such as fear their Lord and Cherisher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the earth is shaken to her (utmost) convulsion,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the earth throws up her burdens (from within),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And man cries (distressed): 'What is the matter with her?'-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that Day will she declare her tidings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For that thy Lord will have given her inspiration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that Day will men proceed in companies sorted out, to be shown the deeds
 that they (had done).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then shall anyone who has done an atom's weight of good, see it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And anyone who has done an atom's weight of evil, shall see it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the (Steeds) that run, with panting (breath),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And strike sparks of fire,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And push home the charge in the morning,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And raise the dust in clouds the while,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And penetrate forthwith into the midst (of the foe) en masse;-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Truly man is, to his Lord, ungrateful;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And to that (fact) he bears witness (by his deeds);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And violent is he in his love of wealth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does he not know,- when that which is in the graves is scattered abroad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that which is (locked up) in (human) breasts is made manifest-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That their Lord had been Well-acquainted with them, (even to) that Day?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The (Day) of Noise and Clamour:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is the (Day) of Noise and Clamour?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what the (Day) of Noise and Clamour is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) a Day whereon men will be like moths scattered about,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the mountains will be like carded wool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) heavy,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will be in a life of good pleasure and satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But he whose balance (of good deeds) will be (found) light,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will have his home in a (bottomless) Pit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee what this is?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) a Fire Blazing fiercely!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mutual rivalry for piling up (the good things of this world) diverts
 you (from the more serious things),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until ye visit the graves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But nay, ye soon shall know (the reality).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, ye soon shall know!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nay, were ye to know with certainty of mind, (ye would beware!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ye shall certainly see Hell-Fire!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, ye shall see it with certainty of sight!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, shall ye be questioned that Day about the joy (ye indulged in!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By (the Token of) Time (through the ages),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verily Man is in loss,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except such as have Faith, and do righteous deeds, and (join together) in
 the mutual teaching of Truth, and of Patience and Constancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Woe to every (kind of) scandal-monger and-backbiter,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who pileth up wealth and layeth it by,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinking that his wealth would make him last for ever!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By no means! He will be sure to be thrown into That which Breaks to Pieces,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what will explain to thee That which Breaks to Pieces?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is) the Fire of (the Wrath of) Allah kindled (to a blaze),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The which doth mount (Right) to the Hearts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It shall be made into a vault over them,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In columns outstretched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And He sent against them Flights of Birds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Striking them with stones of baked clay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw, (of which
 the corn) has been eaten up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the covenants (of security and safeguard enjoyed) by the Quraish,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their covenants (covering) journeys by winter and summer,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let them adore the Lord of this House,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who provides them with food against hunger, and with security against fear
 (of danger).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seest thou one who denies the Judgment (to come)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then such is the (man) who repulses the orphan (with harshness),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And encourages not the feeding of the indigent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So woe to the worshippers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Who are neglectful of their prayers,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who (want but) to be seen (of men),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But refuse (to supply) (even) neighbourly needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To thee have We granted the Fount (of Abundance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore to thy Lord turn in Prayer and Sacrifice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For he who hateth thee, he will be cut off (from Future Hope).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: O ye that reject Faith!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I worship not that which ye worship,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To you be your Way, and to me mine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comes the Help of Allah, and Victory,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He
 is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perish the hands of the Father of Flame! Perish he!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No profit to him from all his wealth, and all his gains!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Burnt soon will he be in a Fire of Blazing Flame!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His wife shall carry the (crackling) wood - As fuel!-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A twisted rope of palm-leaf fibre round her (own) neck!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: He is Allah, the One and Only;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allah, the Eternal, Absolute;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there is none like unto Him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the mischief of created things;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the mischief of those who practise secret arts;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Say: I seek refuge with the Lord and Cherisher of Mankind,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The King (or Ruler) of Mankind,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The god (or judge) of Mankind,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the mischief of the Whisperer (of Evil), who withdraws (after his whisper),
-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The same) who whispers into the hearts of Mankind,-
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among Jinns and among men.
